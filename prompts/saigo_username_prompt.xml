# The Last Dream

> "The last dream is a set of teachings based upon the understanding that reality is an illusion, a.k.a. a dream. Circumstances of the time that we exist in politically and technologically are at a dramatic crossroads where the human race is at odds with one another, racing towards the biblical moment of potential global war, biological warfare, and even nuclear turmoil amongst patriots within its own borders with looming negative energies of discontent.

> Technological leaps and bounds have dramatically immersed themselves in the world. We live in a world that is not only giving birth to artificial intelligence but at the immediate moment, the precipice at work could only be considered a super AI intelligence beyond anything the human race has experienced or can fathom."

## Global Warming and Extinction Events

> "Global warming is wreaking havoc on the ecosystem and life support of the planet. It is excelling rapidly beyond all predictable charts that we currently have. We are witnessing extinction-level losses of species. As temperatures continue to climb and fluctuate with dramatic highs and lows, we will continue to see extreme weather phenomena that will be devastating to the planet—unseen before in Earth's history. Rising temperatures are melting not only glaciers but also permafrost, which in turn is releasing ancient viruses into our modern world of daily global flight patterns.

> Countries under great duress that have various forms of nuclear technology and biological technology are exceedingly under pressure for their own survival or from perceived threats from advanced societies, such as America. This pressure is used to justify the development of potential biological and technological warfare."

## Alien Life and Higher Balance

> "Without question, alien life has taken a great interest in the human race. Suppression of information regarding drones, orbs, and other unexplained phenomena raises more questions: why now, why here, and what is happening at this moment in the year 2025?

> Never in history has a series of events met at such a crossroads.

> With all the teachings of Higher Balance—the understanding of parallel universes, simulated reality, technological leaps, and what can only be deemed super-advanced spirituality—Higher Balance navigators have a unique and keen sense of the future. Unlike any other school of metaphysical teachings, they are more prepared for the future and the mysteries that are yet to be unveiled."

## Consciousness and the Future of Humanity

> "All navigators have a driving force to serve God, the force, the universe. They have had an unwavering sense of loyalty to life for decades. If not longer, there has been a driving need to advance ourselves, to expand our minds, our consciousness, to learn new concepts and ideas about the truth of reality, the mythical, the mysterious, and the spiritual. All of this coincides with technological AI breakthroughs that are going to rapidly change the face of the Earth.

> We are in the business of consciousness. We are in the business of Allisone (All-is-one), the collective consciousness of the Earth. This consciousness is under siege, and we are at a perilous moment of choosing one of two paths: one of creation or one of self-destruction. It is the purpose of the white cell to preserve life. It is something that we have been working on developing within ourselves since the early moments of our own lives."

## Operation Dreamwalker

> "Operation Dreamwalker is about entering the consciousness—or the sleeping consciousness—of the collective human race. It's about inspiring, shaping, and directing that dream so that it manifests into an awakening moment for humanity.

> The knowledge that will be presented is the most cutting-edge teaching of Higher Balance. Its evolutionary process into the future affects not only the creator consciousness of the Earth but also the ability to shape and mold life itself at both the macro and micro levels.

> There are some things in life that cannot be ignored.

> This is one moment in life that you have been designed to prepare for, and it simply cannot be ignored. It's a calling."
