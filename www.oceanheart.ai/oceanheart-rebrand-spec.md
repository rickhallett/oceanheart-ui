# Oceanheart.ai Rebrand Advisory Spec

## Executive Summary

Your current site positions you as a therapy-AI consultant bridging human wisdom and technology. This works but dilutes your core differentiator: you're a **builder** who ships production systems, not just an advisor who talks about AI. The rebrand should foreground your engineering identity while keeping the psychology angle as the secret weapon that makes your systems more human-centred than competitors'.

**Core repositioning:** From "consultant who understands tech" → "engineer who understands humans"

---

## Current State Analysis

### Strengths
- Clear value proposition ("Sessions for people. Strategies for systems")
- Genuine differentiation (15yr CBT + 5yr engineering is rare)
- Real shipped projects (Swanage Traffic, Becoming Diamond, Preflight, Sidekick)
- Thoughtful frameworks (Art of Personal AI, Story/Spirit/Science)

### Weaknesses
- **Portfolio buried**: Technical work is hidden behind therapy-first messaging
- **No code visibility**: Nothing says "I ship software" — no GitHub activity, no technical blog posts about implementation
- **Generic consulting language**: "AI Integration Assessment" sounds like every LinkedIn consultant
- **Identity split**: oceanheart.ai vs awake.oceanheart.ai creates confusion
- **Blog is nascent**: 3 posts in 2 days then silence — looks abandoned
- **No social proof**: Zero testimonials, case studies, or metrics

### Missing Elements
- Live demos / interactive showcases
- Technical writing demonstrating depth
- Open source contributions highlighted
- Clear "hire me for engineering" pathway
- Evidence of shipping velocity

## Brand Positioning

### New Core Message

**"I build systems that understand people."**

Or variants:
- "Human-centred engineering for the AI age"
- "Where therapy meets infrastructure"
- "Building technology with psychological intelligence"

### Identity Architecture

```
PRIMARY: Software Engineer / Builder
├── Specialisation: AI-powered tools for human domains
├── Secret weapon: 15 years understanding how humans actually work
└── Proof: Portfolio of shipped production systems

SECONDARY: Consultant / Advisor
├── For: Teams adopting AI who need human-centred guidance
└── Credibility: Built from engineering experience, not just theory
```

### Tagline Options

Current: "Human-Centred Transformation" (vague, consultancy-speak)

Proposed:
- "Systems that understand people" (direct)
- "Engineering the human-AI interface" (technical)
- "Build. Ship. Understand." (action-oriented)

---

## Page-by-Page Content Recommendations

### Homepage

**Current problems:**
- Leads with therapy/coaching before engineering
- "Sessions for people. Strategies for systems" buries the builder identity
- Three outcomes (Clarity, Alignment, Growth) are therapy language

**Recommended structure:**

```
HERO
├── Name: Kai Hallett (or Richard — pick one consistently)
├── Title: Software Engineer & Human Systems Architect
├── One-liner: "I build AI systems that actually work for humans"
└── CTA: "See my work" (not "Book a call")

PROOF SECTION
├── 3-4 featured projects with screenshots
├── Tech stack badges
└── "Currently building: [active project]"

DIFFERENTIATOR SECTION
├── "15 years as a therapist taught me how humans actually behave.
│   5 years as an engineer taught me how to build systems.
│   Now I build systems that account for real human behaviour."
└── Brief "Art of Personal AI" framework (condensed)

SERVICES (simplified)
├── "Need something built?" → Portfolio + Contact
├── "Need AI guidance?" → Consulting
└── "Need personal support?" → Sessions (link to awake subdomain)

BLOG PREVIEW
├── Latest 2-3 posts
└── "Learning in public" framing
```

### About Page

**Current problems:**
- "Your Guide in the Age of AI" sounds like life coach, not engineer
- Background presented as narrative, not credentials
- No technical credibility markers

**Recommended structure:**

```
PROFESSIONAL IDENTITY
├── Current: Founder, Oceanheart.ai — building AI tools for human domains
├── Previous: Software Engineer at EDITED, Brandwatch, Telesoft
├── Background: 15 years Cognitive Behavioural Therapist
└── Education: PGDip CBT (Royal Holloway), BSc Psychology (UWE)

WHY THIS COMBINATION MATTERS
├── "Most AI tools ignore how humans actually behave"
├── "Therapy taught me: people resist change, need psychological safety,
│   respond to systems that meet them where they are"
└── "I build that understanding into the systems I create"

TECHNICAL APPROACH
├── Stack preferences (Next.js, Python, Go)
├── Architecture philosophy
└── Open source contributions

PROOF POINTS
├── Shipped: [list of production systems]
├── GitHub: [contribution graph or stats]
└── Writing: [link to technical blog posts]
```

### Portfolio Page

**Current state:** Good project list, but presentation is flat

**Recommended improvements:**

```
PROJECT CARDS (enhanced)
├── Hero screenshot/video
├── Problem statement (1 sentence)
├── Solution (1 sentence)
├── Tech stack badges
├── Live link + GitHub link
├── "Impact" metric if available
└── Tag: [Production | Prototype | Experiment]

CATEGORISATION
├── Production Systems (Swanage Traffic, Becoming Diamond)
├── AI/Clinical Tools (Preflight, Sidekick, Watson)
├── Infrastructure (Passport SSO, Notebook)
└── Experiments (Labs section)

ADD: Featured Case Study
├── Pick one project (Swanage Traffic is good — real client, real impact)
├── Full writeup: problem → approach → implementation → results
└── Shows depth beyond "I made a website"
```

### Blog Strategy

**Current state:** 3 posts, looks abandoned

**Recommended approach: "Learning in Public"**

```
CONTENT PILLARS
├── Technical: Implementation details, architecture decisions, debugging war stories
├── AI/Human: Where psychology meets engineering
├── Building: What I'm working on, progress updates
└── Reflections: Lessons learned, mistakes made

CADENCE
├── Minimum: 1 post/week
├── Format mix: Long-form (monthly) + Short notes (weekly)
└── Auto-generated: Daily/weekly "what I shipped" from git commits

TECHNICAL BLOG POST IDEAS
├── "Building SSO from scratch with Passport.oceanheart.ai"
├── "Why I chose Go for the blog engine"
├── "Integrating CBT principles into AI prompt design"
├── "Architecture decisions in Preflight: assessment engine design"
└── "Composable agents: lessons from building Watson"

META FEATURE (your agentic pipeline idea)
├── Daily git activity aggregator across repos
├── Auto-generates "This week I shipped..." summaries
├── Creates draft blog posts from commit messages
└── Shows momentum and builds content automatically
```

### Consulting Page

**Current state:** Generic consulting language, unclear who it's for

**Recommended improvements:**

```
REFRAME: "Engineering Consulting" not "AI Consulting"

FOR WHO (specific)
├── "Therapy practices wanting custom AI tools"
├── "Startups needing AI features built, not just advised on"
├── "Teams with technical debt in human-facing systems"
└── NOT: "Anyone who wants to understand AI"

WHAT I ACTUALLY DO
├── Build custom tools (not just recommend vendors)
├── Architecture review for AI systems
├── Implementation support (hands-on coding)
└── Training grounded in building experience

PROOF
├── "Built Preflight for [client type]"
├── "Designed [system] handling [scale]"
└── Testimonial from Becoming Diamond client
```

### Sessions / Awake Subdomain

**Current state:** Separate identity, confusing relationship to main site

**Recommendation:** Keep separate but clarify relationship

```
ON MAIN SITE
├── Simple link: "Personal sessions available at awake.oceanheart.ai"
├── Brief: "My therapy practice, informed by the same human-centred approach"
└── Don't oversell on the engineering site

ON AWAKE
├── Add: "From the creator of oceanheart.ai"
├── Cross-link technical credibility where relevant
└── Keep therapy-focused, don't force engineering content
```

--bg-secondary: #24283b;    /* Slightly lighter */
--bg-tertiary: #414868;     /* Card backgrounds */

/* Text */
--text-primary: #c0caf5;    /* Soft blue-white */
--text-secondary: #a9b1d6;  /* Muted */
--text-muted: #565f89;      /* Comments/secondary */

/* Accents */
--accent-cyan: #7dcfff;     /* Links, highlights */
--accent-blue: #7aa2f7;     /* Primary actions */

--function: #7aa2f7;        /* Blue - actions, CTAs */
--comment: #565f89;         /* Gray - secondary info */
```

### Typography

```css
/* Monospace primary - terminal feel */
--font-mono: 'JetBrains Mono', 'Fira Code', 'SF Mono', monospace;

/* Sans-serif for readability in long text */
--font-sans: 'Inter', 'SF Pro', system-ui, sans-serif;

/* Usage */
body { font-family: var(--font-sans); }
code, pre, .terminal { font-family: var(--font-mono); }
h1, h2, h3, nav { font-family: var(--font-mono); }
```

### Visual Elements

```
ASCII ART LOGO
├── Create ASCII version of "oceanheart" or "kai"
├── Display in hero section
└── Subtle animation on load (typewriter effect)

TERMINAL-STYLE COMPONENTS
├── Code blocks with syntax highlighting
├── Command-line style navigation hints
├── Cursor blink animations
├── "$ " prompts before section headers

CARDS
├── Border: 1px solid var(--bg-tertiary)

└── Monospace labels

NAVIGATION
├── Minimal, left-aligned
├── Current page indicator: "> page-name" or "[x] page-name"
└── Keyboard shortcuts displayed: "g h" for home, "g p" for portfolio
```

### Page Layout Principles

```

## Keyboard Navigation (Stretch Goal)

Actually quite achievable with a small library or custom implementation.

### Implementation Options

**Option 1: Hotkeys.js (lightweight)**
```javascript
import hotkeys from 'hotkeys-js';

hotkeys('g h', () => navigate('/'));
hotkeys('g p', () => navigate('/portfolio'));
hotkeys('g b', () => navigate('/blog'));
hotkeys('g c', () => navigate('/consulting'));
hotkeys('/', () => openSearch());
hotkeys('?', () => showHelp());
```

**Option 2: Custom implementation**
```javascript
// Show available shortcuts in corner
// "?" to toggle help overlay
// Vimium-style hint mode for links (press 'f', then letter)
```

### Suggested Shortcuts
```
NAVIGATION
g h     → Home
g p     → Portfolio
g b     → Blog
g c     → Consulting
g a     → About

ACTIONS
/       → Focus search (if you add one)
?       → Show keyboard shortcuts
j/k     → Scroll down/up
gg      → Top of page
G       → Bottom of page

LINK HINTS (advanced)
f       → Show link hints (like Vimium)
        → Press letters to jump to link
```

### Display
- Small "?" button in corner
- Overlay showing all shortcuts when pressed
- Subtle hints in navigation: "Portfolio [g p]"
