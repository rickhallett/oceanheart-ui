Revived SATI, a meditation antipattern assistant that had been dormant for a couple of months, bringing it back to life as a fully-featured app with LLM classification, session persistence, comprehensive documentation, and mobile-optimized UI in a single intensive development session.

#### Highlights

- Brought dormant meditation antipattern assistant back to life with Next.js 15, LLM classification, and streaming chat API

- Implemented comprehensive documentation system with syntax highlighting and case studies

- Added session persistence with SQLite database for longitudinal pattern tracking across meditation sessions

- Created thread metrics and recurring pattern analysis for practitioners

- Developed responsive UI with Tokyo Terminal Light theme and mobile optimization

- Rebranded from 'koan' to 'SATI' with animated logo and whitelabel configuration system

#### Technical Decisions

- Chose Next.js 15 with App Router for modern React architecture

- Implemented SQLite with Drizzle ORM for local development persistence

- Added device-based identity using localStorage UUID for session tracking

- Used prism-react-renderer for code syntax highlighting in documentation

- Built whitelabel configuration system in lib/config.ts for easy rebranding

- Implemented streaming chat API with LLM confidence calibration and safety guardrails

#### Learning Moments

- Explored meditation antipattern taxonomy and LLM classification systems

- Experimented with confidence calibration and response strategy selection

- Learned mobile-first responsive design patterns for chat interfaces

- Discovered challenges with ASCII art tables, migrated to proper HTML components

- Explored longitudinal data tracking for meditation practice analysis
