Completed a major v2 overhaul of 'the-architecture-of-persuasion' with conversational content rewrite, dual reading modes, interactive polls, and enhanced evidence system. The day involved systematic feature development across 5 phases with minimal debugging needed.

#### Highlights

- Complete v2 content rewrite with conversational, snarky tone replacing formal 'Pillar' structure

- Implemented dual reading modes (skim/deep) with localStorage persistence and smooth transitions

- Built interactive poll system with vote tracking, results visualization, and anti-repeat voting logic

- Enhanced evidence modal with act-specific badge system and clipboard functionality

- Updated intro screen to match provocative v2 tone and branding

#### Technical Decisions

- Chose localStorage for client-side state persistence across reading modes and poll voting

- Implemented backward compatibility with v1 pillar format while supporting v2 sections structure

- Used CSS bar charts for poll results visualization rather than external charting library

- Added toast notifications with CSS animations for user feedback

- Structured content parsing to handle both skim and deep reading formats

#### Learning Moments

- Explored client-side state management patterns for reading preferences

- Implemented clipboard API integration for evidence link sharing

- Developed dual rendering system for same content in different formats

- Created animated UI components using pure CSS transitions
