Executed an ambitious parallel development strategy using git worktrees to simultaneously build 6 major feature streams (design system, CMS, content pages, interactive features, user features, animations) and successfully integrated them all into a cohesive Next.js application with comprehensive testing and performance optimization.

#### Highlights

- Implemented comprehensive parallel development plan with 6 development streams using git worktrees

- Built complete design system with 16 UI components and 98.67% test coverage

- Developed full Sanity CMS infrastructure with schemas, queries, and utilities

- Created interactive features including fuzzy search, event calendar, and filtering system

- Implemented user authentication, bookmarks, and reading progress tracking

- Added animations and performance optimization infrastructure with Framer Motion

- Successfully integrated all 6 feature streams with dependency resolution and build fixes

#### Technical Decisions

- Adopted git worktrees strategy for true parallel development across 6 feature streams

- Chose comprehensive testing approach with Jest achieving >95% coverage across all metrics

- Implemented Zustand for state management in interactive features

- Selected Sanity CMS as headless content management solution with custom schemas

- Integrated NextAuth.js for authentication with multiple provider support

- Used Framer Motion for animation system with performance budgets and Lighthouse CI

#### Learning Moments

- Explored advanced git worktree workflows for managing parallel development streams

- Implemented multi-agent orchestration approach with specialized agents per worktree

- Experimented with fuzzy search using Fuse.js with weighted search scoring

- Applied comprehensive design token system for consistent UI styling

- Learned FullCalendar integration with timezone support and ICS export functionality
