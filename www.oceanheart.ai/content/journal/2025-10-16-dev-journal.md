A massive project restructure adding nearly 48k lines of code to prepare for Next.js migration, including setup of an AI agent system for development workflow automation. This appears to be a significant architectural overhaul moving from Backbone.js to a modern React/Next.js stack.

#### Highlights

- Major project restructure with 47,576 lines added across 136 files

- Set up comprehensive AI agent system with specialized roles (architecture analyzer, backbone-to-react migrator, dashboard docs generator, nextjs converter)

- Established structured AI command system for development workflow automation

- Prepared codebase for Next.js migration from existing framework

#### Technical Decisions

- Decision to migrate to Next.js framework from current setup

- Implementation of AI-assisted development workflow with specialized agents

- Adoption of structured command system for AI interactions

- Migration from Backbone.js to React architecture

#### Learning Moments

- Exploring AI-driven development processes with agent-based workflow

- Investigating Next.js migration patterns and best practices

- Experimenting with automated documentation generation

- Learning modern React patterns while migrating from Backbone.js
