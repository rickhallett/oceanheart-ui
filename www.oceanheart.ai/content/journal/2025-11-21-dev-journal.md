Focused day on deployment optimization and infrastructure cleanup, successfully reducing serverless functions to meet Vercel limits while fixing several development and production issues. Major accomplishment was simplifying the architecture by removing external dependencies and ensuring proper production deployment.

#### Highlights

- Successfully reduced serverless functions from excess to 10 to comply with Vercel Hobby tier limits

- Removed external dependency on Notion for feature flags, simplifying architecture

- Fixed multiple UI/UX issues including navigation FOUC and API proxy configuration

- Re-enabled registration forms and added survey modal functionality

- Organized static assets for proper production deployment

#### Technical Decisions

- Chose to remove unused API endpoints rather than upgrade Vercel plan

- Replaced Notion-based feature flags with environment variables for simpler configuration

- Moved static files to public directory to ensure proper serving in production builds

- Updated Vite proxy configuration to match correct development server port

#### Learning Moments

- Discovered Vercel Hobby tier function limits and how to work within constraints

- Learned to prevent Flash of Unstyled Content (FOUC) by reserving space for dynamic components

- Gained experience with Vite proxy configuration for API routing
