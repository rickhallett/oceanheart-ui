Major architectural upgrade migrating from JSON to SQLite database storage while simultaneously adding Gmail inbox monitoring capabilities with automated email processing.

#### Highlights

- Successfully migrated data storage from JSON to SQLite database with proper schema design

- Implemented comprehensive database migration tooling and query utilities

- Added Gmail inbox monitoring system with automated email classification

- Updated existing components (email_matcher.py, status.py) to use new SQLite backend

- Set up systemd automation for continuous inbox monitoring

#### Technical Decisions

- Chose SQLite over JSON for better data querying and relational structure

- Implemented proper database schema with separate tables for applications, timeline, contacts, and emails

- Added data archiving strategy to preserve original JSON data

- Integrated Gmail API with OAuth for email monitoring

- Used systemd timers for automated background processing

#### Learning Moments

- Explored Gmail API integration and OAuth authentication flow

- Learned SQLite NULL value handling patterns in Python applications

- Implemented database migration patterns for data format transitions
