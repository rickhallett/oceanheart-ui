Initial project setup for a reinforcement learning framework integrating Atropos and Axolotl, with comprehensive planning for game-based training scenarios ranging from simple validation to complex multi-agent environments.

#### Highlights

- Established new RL framework repository with clear project structure

- Integrated Atropos and Axolotl as submodules for reinforcement learning capabilities

- Created comprehensive documentation including README and development guidance

- Defined concrete training plans for both validation (Tic-Tac-Toe) and complex scenarios (Diplomacy)

- Laid foundation for systematic RL experimentation with game-based training

#### Technical Decisions

- Used git submodules to integrate Atropos and Axolotl frameworks rather than direct dependencies

- Chose game-based approach for RL training with dual-complexity strategy (simple validation + complex application)

- Structured project with separate planning documents for different training scenarios

- Included CLAUDE.md suggesting AI-assisted development workflow

#### Learning Moments

- Exploring reinforcement learning framework integration patterns

- Setting up systematic approach to game-based RL training

- Establishing documentation-driven development process for complex RL projects
