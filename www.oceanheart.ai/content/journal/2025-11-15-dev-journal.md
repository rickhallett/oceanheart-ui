Completed a comprehensive WordPress-to-modern-web migration project, successfully extracting 402 content items and pivoting from Hugo SSG to a Next.js 15 architecture for enhanced interactivity and user experience.

#### Highlights

- Completed Phase 2 content extraction with 100% success rate: 216 articles and 186 events extracted from WordPress site

- Downloaded and organized 169 media assets (32MB) with comprehensive manifest tracking

- Successfully validated all extracted content with YAML frontmatter parsing

- Built complete Hugo static site with custom theme and imported all Phase 2 content

- Pivoted to modern Next.js 15 architecture with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4, and headless CMS approach

- Created comprehensive documentation including completion reports, validation reports, and modern architecture plans

#### Technical Decisions

- Chose Hugo over other SSGs for multi-lingual support and performance, then pivoted to Next.js for modern interactivity

- Implemented systematic batch processing approach for large-scale content extraction

- Used Claude AI assistance extensively for automated content extraction and processing

- Selected Next.js 15 with App Router, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS v4 for final implementation

- Opted for headless CMS (Sanity) approach over static files for content management

#### Learning Moments

- Discovered the limitations of basic SSG approach for interactive features needed

- Learned to handle large-scale content migration with proper rate limiting and error handling

- Explored modern React patterns with Server Components and Server Actions

- Gained experience with systematic content validation and quality assurance processes
