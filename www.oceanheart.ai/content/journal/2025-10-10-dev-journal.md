Built a complete narrative experience called 'The Architecture of Persuasion' - a sophisticated web application that presents the same evidence through 4 different interpretive lenses, demonstrating how AI-augmented engineering can be viewed positively or negatively depending on perspective.

#### Highlights

- Built complete 4-act narrative experience from scratch with Astro SSG framework

- Implemented sophisticated content pipeline parsing markdown to JSON with evidence locker system

- Created 20 evidence items (8 code, 9 text, 3 dialogue) with dual positive/negative interpretations

- Added syntax highlighting with Shiki and act-specific theming across 4 distinct visual identities

- Implemented comprehensive feedback system with Turso database and serverless API endpoints

- Added epistemic pivot analysis with three-part thesis/antithesis/pivot structure

- Completed major UI/UX modernization with editorial design system and cinematic transitions

- Successfully deployed to Vercel with hybrid rendering for API routes

#### Technical Decisions

- Chose Astro SSG over React/Vue for zero-JS base with selective hydration

- Implemented build-time content parsing with remark/unified for robust AST handling

- Selected Turso (libSQL) for serverless database over traditional solutions

- Used state machine architecture with vanilla JS over framework complexity

- Adopted Shiki for syntax highlighting over runtime solutions for performance

- Implemented side drawer evidence modal over centered modal for better UX

#### Learning Moments

- Explored Astro's hybrid rendering model for mixing static and server-side content

- Learned Turso database integration patterns for privacy-respecting analytics

- Experimented with epistemic analysis structure for presenting multiple perspectives

- Discovered effective patterns for build-time content transformation pipelines

- Explored advanced CSS theming with act-specific visual identities
