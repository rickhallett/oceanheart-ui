# Development Journal - 2025-11-30

## Overview

November 30th was focused on infrastructure maturation and data quality improvements across all projects. The day involved significant cleanup work - from removing test data and fixing database integrity issues, to enhancing content quality and implementing production-ready deployment solutions with proper automation.

**Active Projects:** 3
**Total Commits:** 10

## Cross-Project Themes

- Infrastructure and deployment optimization - moving from quick fixes to production-ready solutions

- Data integrity and content quality focus - cleaning up test data, enhancing biographical content, and implementing proper file management

- Development environment standardization - fixing local setups, implementing consistent deployment processes, and creating reusable automation

- Transparency and reliability improvements - removing abstractions for clearer data display, fixing visualization issues, and establishing permanent access solutions

## Projects

### denkoroku

**Commits:** 1 | **Files Changed:** 1

Single focused commit improving biographical content in the main HTML file with significant additions and refinements.

#### Highlights

- Improved biographical content on the main page

- Enhanced user-facing information with substantial content additions

#### Technical Decisions

- Chose to enhance content directly in HTML rather than implementing a separate content management system

### nstcg-org-fork

**Commits:** 6 | **Files Changed:** 6

Completed a comprehensive database optimization effort, removing test data and fixing integrity issues while also resolving development environment configuration problems and restoring proper data visualization.

#### Highlights

- Completed major database optimization removing 136 test records and fixing data integrity issues

- Successfully restored original timestamps from backup to fix campaign momentum graph visualization

- Standardized participant count display and data sources across all API endpoints

- Fixed local development environment by correcting Vercel proxy configuration

#### Technical Decisions

- Removed BASE_COUNT abstraction in favor of displaying actual database counts for transparency

- Switched to using internal database as single source of truth across all API endpoints

- Created utility scripts for data migration and timestamp restoration

- Cleaned up temporary analysis scripts after completing database optimization

#### Learning Moments

- Handling sql.unsafe() backup creation issues during database migrations

- Managing NOT NULL constraint violations during data cleanup operations

- Working with backup data parsing and timestamp restoration from markdown files

### project-sunlight

**Commits:** 3 | **Files Changed:** 9

Implemented a complete browser-based IDE deployment solution with automated VPS setup and created specialized file management agents for the project's documentation lifecycle.

#### Highlights

- Implemented comprehensive browser-based IDE deployment solution using code-server with Docker and Cloudflare Tunnel

- Created automated VPS deployment scripts and documentation for 10-minute setup process

- Developed specialized archiver and unarchiver agents for managing project skeleton files

- Established permanent HTTPS remote access solution costing only $7-10/month

#### Technical Decisions

- Chose code-server over other browser-based IDE solutions for VS Code compatibility

- Selected Cloudflare Tunnel for HTTPS access to avoid domain purchase and SSL certificate management

- Implemented Docker-based deployment for consistency and portability

- Created specialized agents for archive management rather than manual file handling

#### Learning Moments

- Explored browser-based IDE solutions and evaluated 9 different options

- Implemented Cloudflare Tunnel integration for secure remote access

- Developed automated VPS deployment patterns with comprehensive documentation
