Completed a massive content migration from Notion to structured markdown, implementing an innovative parallel agentic development workflow that processed over 230,000 lines across 2,100+ files while establishing comprehensive documentation infrastructure and VPS deployment capabilities.

#### Highlights

- Successfully migrated 230,960+ lines of content from Notion export to structured markdown knowledge base

- Implemented parallel agentic development workflow with 7 specialized migration agents across 3 waves

- Created comprehensive documentation infrastructure with navigation guides, citation standards, and workflow examples

- Established VPS deployment configuration for Hostinger with SSH setup and PowerShell scripts

- Built complete evidence indexing system with cannon-specific organization and master indexes

- Standardized frontmatter across 1,830 markdown files with automated metadata extraction

- Archived skeleton/obsolete content while preserving git history and creating audit trails

#### Technical Decisions

- Chose parallel git worktree strategy over sequential processing to reduce migration time by 40-47%

- Implemented SSH over HTTPS for VPS Git access for better security

- Adopted comprehensive linting/formatting stack (Prettier, Biome, Ruff, markdownlint) with pre-commit hooks

- Used YAML frontmatter standardization for LLM optimization with token counting

- Preserved git history during large-scale file archival operations

#### Learning Moments

- Explored agentic development patterns with specialized migration agents and communication protocols

- Experimented with LLM-optimized knowledge base structure and token management

- Developed systematic approach to Notion-to-markdown migration at scale

- Created reusable documentation orchestration patterns with multiple specialized agents
