Completed Phase 5 of the tome project by implementing a comprehensive SQLite-based execution history system with CLI commands, seamless executor integration, and robust error handling. This major milestone adds full persistence and analytics capabilities to the notebook execution system with 86% test coverage.

#### Highlights

- Implemented complete SQLite-based execution history persistence system with 430 lines of database code and 86% test coverage

- Added comprehensive CLI commands for viewing execution history and statistics with filtering capabilities

- Integrated database storage seamlessly with existing NotebookExecutor with graceful error handling

- Created robust database schema with performance indexes and context manager support for safe resource handling

- Achieved 31/31 passing tests for database functionality with comprehensive coverage of edge cases

- Built rich metadata storage system with JSON support and SHA-256 prompt hash calculation for deduplication

#### Technical Decisions

- Chose SQLite for execution persistence due to its simplicity and zero-configuration requirements

- Implemented graceful degradation where database failures generate warnings but don't break execution flow

- Used SHA-256 hashing for prompt deduplication and JSON for flexible metadata storage

- Added performance indexes on key columns (notebook_path, timestamp, model) for fast query performance

- Designed database integration as optional feature with --no-db flag for users who don't want persistence

#### Learning Moments

- Implemented comprehensive database testing patterns including concurrent write handling and null value management

- Explored context manager patterns for safe SQLite resource handling

- Developed patterns for integrating persistence layers without breaking existing functionality
