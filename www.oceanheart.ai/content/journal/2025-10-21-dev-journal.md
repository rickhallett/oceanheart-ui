Initial project setup day establishing a MkDocs-based site about AI translucence with extensive Claude Code integration for AI-assisted development workflows. The work focused on foundational infrastructure, documentation structure, and advanced AI tooling integration rather than content creation.

#### Highlights

- Successfully initialized a complete MkDocs site with terminal theme and GitHub Pages deployment

- Established comprehensive Claude Code integration with custom agents, slash commands, and workflow automation

- Created professional documentation structure including CV and job application materials

- Set up AI-powered development workflow with specialized agents for architecture analysis and interview preparation

#### Technical Decisions

- Chose MkDocs with terminal theme for console/unix aesthetic alignment with AI translucence concept

- Implemented uv project structure for Python dependency management

- Selected GitHub Pages for static site hosting with automated deployment workflow

- Integrated Claude Code extensively with custom agents and slash commands for AI-assisted development

#### Learning Moments

- Exploring AI-assisted development workflows through Claude Code integration

- Experimenting with NotebookLM for podcast generation from technical documentation

- Setting up comprehensive AI development toolchain with custom agents and automation
