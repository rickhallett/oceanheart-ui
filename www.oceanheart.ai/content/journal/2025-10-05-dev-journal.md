Heavy focus on building visitor-facing AI chat functionality with extensive UI experimentation, creating a complete landing page system and 8 different chat interface prototypes while resolving component compatibility issues.

#### Highlights

- Built complete visitor router landing page with AI chat functionality, SparklesCore effects, and responsive design

- Implemented content compression system for AI chat prompts with build-time optimization

- Created 8 experimental chat interface variations (/labs/chat/v1-v8) exploring different UI component combinations

- Added streaming AI responses with character-by-character animation effects

- Developed visitor-specific API endpoint with Anthropic integration and fallback content

#### Technical Decisions

- Chose Anthropic for AI chat backend with streaming response capability

- Implemented build-time content compression to optimize token usage for AI prompts

- Decided on experimental /labs namespace for UI component testing and exploration

- Selected glass morphism design pattern with backdrop blur and gradient effects

- Implemented character-by-character streaming (20-50ms intervals) for typewriter effects

#### Learning Moments

- Extensive experimentation with aceternity UI components across 8 different chat interface variations

- Exploration of particle effects, background animations, and visual effects combinations

- Testing different approaches to streaming text animation and user interaction patterns

- Learning component compatibility issues between server and client components in Next.js

- Discovering optimal timing patterns for streaming text effects and user experience
