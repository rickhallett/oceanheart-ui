Major integration day combining multiple projects into unified diamond-heart.ai platform with comprehensive service pages, portfolio system, and clear separation of Engineering, AI Consulting, and Kaishin Method offerings. Addressed UX issues and established consistent design patterns across the integrated platform.

#### Highlights

- Massive initial integration project combining three separate repositories (oceanheart-ui, phoenix.oceanheart.ai, becoming-diamond-nextjs) into unified diamond-heart.ai structure

- Built comprehensive portfolio system with 7 featured projects across Product Apps, Websites, System Integrations, and Research categories

- Created complete service pages for AI Consulting and Somatic Sessions with detailed content, FAQs, and pricing

- Integrated private sessions offering (/kai route) with three-pillar framework (Zen, ACT, Somatic) and booking system

- Established clear navigation structure separating Engineering, AI Consulting, and Kaishin Method services

- Implemented responsive design system with Framer Motion animations and scroll-triggered reveals

#### Technical Decisions

- Chose Next.js 15 for the phoenix integration with Next.js 14 compatibility maintained for oceanheart-ui

- Implemented Decap CMS for content management with author relations and predefined categories

- Used Framer Motion for animations with viewport detection and scroll triggers

- Created reusable RevealOnScroll component using Intersection Observer API

- Made /app/support route publicly accessible while keeping other /app/* routes protected

- Standardized on ocean-blue as primary accent color with context-specific exceptions (jade for somatic work)

#### Learning Moments

- Explored advanced dropdown navigation patterns with proper hover state management

- Implemented scroll-triggered animations with Intersection Observer and rootMargin optimization

- Learned CSS writing-mode property for vertical kanji text rendering

- Experimented with single-page scroll layouts with anchor navigation for /kai route
