Accomplished two complete project phases in one day, establishing the full foundation and implementing a comprehensive Markdown parser for the tome project's notebook format with excellent test coverage and documentation.

#### Highlights

- Completed full project foundation setup with Python packaging, CLI interface, testing infrastructure, and CI/CD pipeline

- Successfully implemented complete Markdown parser for .pnb.md files with YAML frontmatter and code block extraction

- Achieved 94% test coverage with 34 comprehensive test cases and strict type checking compliance

- Created comprehensive examples and documentation including syntax reference guide

- Delivered two complete project phases (Phase 0 and Phase 1) in a single day with all exit criteria met

#### Technical Decisions

- Chose Click framework for CLI interface implementation

- Selected pytest with coverage reporting for testing infrastructure

- Implemented dataclass-based AST structure with ParseError exception handling and line number tracking

- Used YAML frontmatter parsing with validation for notebook metadata

- Configured strict mypy type checking and development tools (black, ruff) for code quality

#### Learning Moments

- Explored structured notebook format design with labeled code blocks and attribute parsing

- Implemented comprehensive error handling with helpful messages and line number reporting

- Developed parser for custom .pnb.md format combining YAML frontmatter with enhanced markdown code fences
