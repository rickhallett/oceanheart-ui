### The Problem - Pain Points Section

**Section Title:**
> The **Pressure** You're Under
> Isn't the Problem

**Subtitle:**
> It's that your **nervous system** isn't trained for it

**Pain Points (6):**

1. **Burned Out by Hustle Culture**
   - You're high-functioning but emotionally exhausted. Something is 'off' but you can't name it.

2. **Identity Crisis**
   - After a major life change—divorce, layoff, or transition—you're trying to find your purpose again.

3. **AI Anxiety**
   - You fear becoming irrelevant in a world that's moving too fast. Will you be replaced?

4. **Lost Confidence**
   - You never feel truly confident. Imposter syndrome follows you into every room.

5. **Emotional Dysregulation**
   - Your emotions spike and crash. You're triggered easily and can't get back to center.

6. **Living Small**
   - You're terrified of living a small life—of not being able to protect or provide for your family.

**Quote:**
> "You can't **think** your way into a new identity.
> Your nervous system is running the show.
