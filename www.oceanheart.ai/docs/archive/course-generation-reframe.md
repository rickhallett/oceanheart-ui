This revised version is a strategic business plan.

The key changes are:

1.  **Brand Integration:** All course and program names now reflect the proprietary "Kaishin Method" brand.
2.  **Strategic MVP:** The 90-Day Transformation course we designed is elevated to the flagship Tier 2 offering, providing a robust, high-value MVP.
3.  **Refined Tier 1:** The "30-Day Challenge" is promoted to become the primary, low-risk entry point to the ecosystem, acting as a lead generator and qualifier for the 90-Day course.
4.  **Clearer Progression:** The language of the Circles and Bodies is now woven into the course descriptions, showing customers a clear path of mastery.
5.  **Updated Financials:** The revenue projections and implementation roadmap are updated to reflect this more potent and financially sound launch strategy.

Here is the fully adapted and synthesized Course Generation plan.

# Course Ecosystem & Strategy: The Kaishin Method

## Document Purpose

This document outlines the comprehensive course ecosystem for **The Kaishin Method**, the proprietary framework born from the principles of _Ocean Heart, Ocean Mind_. It leverages Kaishin's unique integration of psychotherapy, software engineering, and contemplative practice to create a clear, tiered path for transformation, from accessible entry points to advanced practitioner certification.

### I. Strategic Framework: The Kaishin Method

**Unique Value Proposition:** The Kaishin Method is the only framework that systematically integrates:

- **The View (Non-dual Wisdom):** The peace of spiritual recognition.
- **The Compass (Psychological Science):** The tools for a meaningful life.
- **The Ground (Somatic Embodiment):** The safety of a regulated nervous system.

**Course Design Principles:** Every offering is designed to develop the **Five Bodies** (Mental, Emotional, Physical, Energetic, Spiritual) by guiding students through the **Eight Circles of Mastery**. Each course is a practical application of the three pillars.

### Course Ladder Architecture

- **Tier 1: Entry Point (The Challenge):** Low-risk, high-value introduction. (£47)
- **Tier 2: Immersion (The Transformation):** Flagship, deep-dive experiences. (£297-£597)
- **Tier 3: Mastery (The Intensives):** Advanced, cohort-based deep work. (£997+)
- **Tier 4: Certification (The Training):** Professional qualification to teach the method. (£5,997+)
