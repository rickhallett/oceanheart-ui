2. **Build progressively** - Create clear pathways from foundation to mastery
3. **Stay integrated** - Every course must embody View + Compass + Ground
4. **Leverage AI** - Use technology to enhance, not replace, human wisdom
5. **Measure transformation** - Focus on student outcomes, not just completion
6. **Create community** - Sticky, ongoing connection keeps people engaged
7. **Scale thoughtfully** - Practitioner training and corporate offerings create leverage

The somatic-bournemouth course example shows that experiential, embodied learning with clear structure works. Apply that model across all offerings while leveraging the Phoenix platform's technical capabilities.

1. Choose 3 courses to develop first
2. Outline detailed curriculum for each
3. Create assessment and feedback mechanisms
4. Pilot with beta cohort
5. Iterate based on feedback
6. Launch publicly
7. Build the ecosystem

This is not just a course business—it's a movement to help people integrate wisdom, psychology, and technology for genuine transformation. The courses are the container; the transformation is the work.
