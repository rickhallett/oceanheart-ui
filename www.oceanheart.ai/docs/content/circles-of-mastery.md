### **The 8 Circles of Personal Mastery**

The journey is a progressive deepening of self-knowledge and embodiment. The first seven circles are an internal pilgrimage. Service to others is not a step to be achieved but a natural consequence of the profound inner work completed.

- **Circles 0-7: The Path of Personal Mastery.** A deep dive into the cultivation and integration of one's own being.
- **Circle 8: The Path of Embodied Service.** When the inner vessel is full, it naturally overflows to nourish the world.

### Circle 1: Guided Practice

**You can execute core practices with external structure and guidance.**

- **Mental Body:** Follows guided meditations on observing thoughts; completes values clarification worksheets.
- **Emotional Body:** Practices a guided body scan to notice sensations; uses grounding techniques when prompted.
- **Energetic Body:** Participates in guided chakra meditations; follows instructions for Tanden breathing.
- **Physical Body:** Follows a pre-made ketogenic meal plan; learns beginner bodyweight progressions from videos.
- **Spiritual Body:** Listens to talks on non-duality; sits for 5-10 minutes in silence with a timer.

### Circle 2: Independence

**You can apply practices independently in your daily life.**

- **Mental Body:** Independently uses cognitive defusion techniques (e.g., thanking the mind) when stressed; sets weekly goals based on clarified values.
- **Emotional Body:** Self-initiates grounding techniques when feeling triggered; can name and locate emotions in the body without prompting.
- **Energetic Body:** Practices daily Tanden breathing to build a foundation; can sense basic energetic states (e.g., "I feel drained" vs. "I feel vibrant").
- **Physical Body:** Plans and prepares their own ketogenic meals; maintains a consistent, independent bodyweight training schedule.
- **Spiritual Body:** Practices unguided silent meditation daily; begins to spontaneously notice the "gap" between thoughts during the day.

---

### Circle 3: Internalization & Consistency

**Practices become reliable habits and your baseline state begins to shift.**

- **Mental Body:** The habit of observing thoughts is ingrained; values-based living becomes more automatic than impulsive decision-making.
- **Emotional Body:** The nervous system's baseline is calmer; emotional reactivity is noticeably lessened in frequency and intensity.
- **Energetic Body:** A consistent sense of energetic centeredness in the lower abdomen (Tanden) becomes a familiar anchor throughout the day.
- **Physical Body:** Metabolic flexibility improves; strength and mobility gains are consistent and noticeable; intermittent fasting feels natural.
- **Spiritual Body:** The recognition of being the "witness" is a frequent and easily accessible state, no longer just a concept.

---

### Circle 4: Optimization & Refinement

**You skillfully fine-tune your internal systems for greater harmony and effectiveness.**

- **Mental Body:** Diagnoses personal cognitive distortions and actively rewires them; refines values into nuanced principles for living.
- **Emotional Body:** Increases the "window of tolerance" to be with more intense emotions (both positive and negative) without overwhelm.
- **Energetic Body:** Learns to consciously clear minor energetic blockages through breath and focused attention; refines Naikan practice for deeper self-understanding.
- **Physical Body:** Customizes their diet (e.g., cyclical keto, carb timing) for specific goals; masters intermediate bodyweight skills and introduces isometrics.
- **Spiritual Body:** Deepens concentration (samadhi) in meditation; investigates subtle layers of the ego structure with discerning awareness.

---

### Circle 5: Integration & Synthesis

**The boundaries between the bodies dissolve; you experience them as a unified, interconnected whole.**

- **Mental Body:** Mental clarity is directly experienced as a result of physical diet (ketosis); values (ACT) and the "View" (Zen) are seen as two descriptions of the same truth.
- **Emotional Body:** Emotional states are felt as energetic movements within the body, devoid of mandatory cognitive stories. Trauma release is experienced somatically and energetically simultaneously.
- **Energetic Body:** The flow of energy is understood to directly impact emotional state and mental clarity. A vibrant energetic body is felt as the foundation for spiritual insight.
- **Physical Body:** Bodyweight training becomes a moving meditation; breathwork is a tool that bridges the physical, energetic, and spiritual realms in a single practice.
- **Spiritual Body:** The non-dual understanding ("The View") is no longer a mental concept but a felt sense, grounded and embodied ("The Ground") in a regulated nervous system.

---

### Circle 6: Subtle Mastery & Resilience

**You navigate the deepest layers of your being and develop unshakable equanimity.**

- **Mental Body:** Gains insight into the archetypal and transpersonal dimensions of the mind; maintains clarity and sanity during profound existential questioning.
- **Emotional Body:** Can consciously and safely navigate and integrate deep-seated shadow material and core wounds.
- **Energetic Body:** Develops sensitivity to the more subtle layers of the energetic field; can maintain energetic sovereignty in chaotic environments.
- **Physical Body:** Achieves a state of intuitive eating and movement, knowing precisely what the body needs beyond any external system. Masters the nervous system's response to extreme stress (e.g., prolonged cold, intense exertion).
- **Spiritual Body:** Navigates "dark night of the soul" phenomena with profound trust and wisdom; attachment to spiritual experiences falls away, leaving only pure presence.

---

### Circle 7: Effortless Being & Radiance

**The practices have become who you are. Your state of being is the practice.**

- **Mental Body:** The mind rests in its natural state: open, clear, and luminous. It is a tool to be used, not a master to be served.
- **Emotional Body:** A deep, abiding sense of compassion for all of your own emotional states is the default. The heart is permanently open.
- **Energetic Body:** The body is a clear vessel for life force to move through; there is a natural radiance that is felt without effort.
- **Physical Body:** The body is experienced as pure aliveness and intelligence, a manifestation of spirit in form, maintained with effortless grace.
- **Spiritual Body:** The distinction between "meditation" and "life" has completely dissolved. Being is effortless. There is no longer a "doer" separate from the action.

---

### Circle 8: Embodied Wisdom & Service

**The culmination of personal mastery, where a full inner world naturally overflows to serve the whole.**

- **Mental Body:** Can create and articulate new psychological and spiritual models that are holistic and transformative. Skillfully and compassionately guides others out of their own cognitive traps.
- **Emotional Body:** Embodies unshakable compassion. Can hold a profound, safe, and transformative container for the deepest emotional and trauma healing of others.
- **Energetic Body:** Can transmit states of peace and presence, facilitating energetic shifts in others through resonance and intention.
