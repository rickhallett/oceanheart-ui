The Kaishin Method (TKM) - Core Concepts

- TKM starts easy. Day by day you get stronger, more disciplined, more familiar, more comfortable. 5 minutes becomes 10, which becomes 20, then 40, and more.
- Want to change in 5 minutes a day? Easy tricks your doctor doesn’t want you to know? It's bullshit and you know it. Go back to TikTok, or say hello to The Real.
- Stress builds resilience. Sorry, no two ways about it. And so I begin to add on resistance. Not too much, not too little.
- By the end, you’ll hardly recognise yourself. But isn’t that what you want, in a way? To look in the mirror and see who you really are?
- TKM is data driven. You’ll get into the habit of checking in with yourself, with the app. Real time feedback keeps you on track, keeps you accountable. Keeps you connected to me. Keeps you connected to support. Every person who completes the program makes it better for the next one who enters. We get what we give; TKM helps you pay it forward.
- The TKM community is built for avatars. Old hands give their support for free, because they learned the best way to learn was to teach what they too had found. What you can find, too.
- Every mechanic has been thought through. Iron clad behavioural science underpins every method, every prompt, every form. The very clicks on this website are consciously designed to help carry you through ups and downs, building the new circuitry you need to survive in a rapidly changing world.
- Communication, logic, health. The three most important pillars that underly all other progress.
- What else? The five bodies.
- What is the one thing? Attention. Attention is all you need.
- Intentional focus, open ended results, as unique as you are.

TKM Brainstorming

TKM Positioning & Messaging

- Augmented Intelligence, not Artificial Intelligence: This is a key differentiator.
- Target Audience: AI for the discerning customer, not the masses.
- Core Message: Everyone has AI wrong. It's not a case of "clone me" anymore than you can ask someone else to understand what you most care about by listening to your garbage for 12 hours non-stop every time they ask a question. Quality, not quantity.
- Website Funnel: Ultra minimal homepage. Funnel intake: clients, businesses, recruiters, curious cats.
- Humor: Incorporate my humor.
- Preflight Hook: More than half of people asked think they are better than average with ChatGPT. Here’s the rub: you have no idea what you are doing. Come find out why.
- Feedback Loop: Every page: "Any questions? Ask them here." Collect questions. Respond manually and/or with email AI for a personal touch.
- Product Integration: Product integration is more impressive than many apps. One large, high-quality codebase (oceanheart.ai). One repo, site, one auth, one database. Collect data.

Content & Style Generation

- Core Books for LM Notebook: ACT, Awake, Practical Zen, Kiloby Inquiries, Body Knows the Score, Applied Breathwork, Convict Conditioning, Russian Infantry Mobility Secrets, The Kratos Project: the lost art of isometric training, The Neurobiology of Therapy
  - Strip authors (with greatest respects).
  - Index the absolute shit out of it.
  - Daily Practice: Converse with these books. Get to know them inside and out.
  - Daily Practice: Generate a fresh podcast on these books. Walk and absorb.
  - Daily Practice: Choose a section. Reword it. Record it. Post it.
- Personal Style Database (`styledb`):
  - Daily: Just write. Capture my style. Add the best parts to my style db.
  - Product: `styledb` - you. recorded.

AI Fine-Tuning Intake

- Site/app intake for self/other to capture Q/A pairs for AI fine-tuning.
- Help oAI get better with training Au-Int → watson.

90 days: the core systems of change (Final 7-Tier Structure)

ALL program elements grow in duration and intensity slowly over the course of the program; components are added one at a time to prevent overload but stimulate continual adaption and learning.
Every exercise is recorded and measured. This is a data driven program. Spiritual engineering.
Number go up. Lizard brain get excite.
By the end, we find the optimal algorithm for YOU. All true development is idiosyncratic and 99% of systems fail because they over simplify, over promise and under deliver.

Core Philosophy

- There is no one size fits all.
- Pain is necessary.
- There are no shortcuts.
- Change takes time
- You get out what you put in.
- Repetition is everything
- Knock, and the door will be opened. Seek, and you WILL find.
- Join the countless men and women who found the truth; and the truth set them free.
- Discipline is freedom.
- In the age of AI what doesn’t change?
  - adaption is limited by biology, time, energy and entropy
  - you get as strong as you embrace challenge
  - you only truly know what you become
