### **The Transformation: From Circle 1 to 3**

- **At Day 1, the student...** intellectually understands they need a change. They are guided by external instruction (**Circle 1**).
- **At Day 45, the student...** is independently using grounding and defusion techniques in their daily life. They are making conscious, values-aligned choices (**Circle 2**).
- **At Day 90, the student...** has a more regulated nervous system as their new baseline. Their values naturally inform their decisions. They have a stable recognition of the aware space at the ground of Being. The practices are becoming second nature (**Circle 3**). They have successfully built an inner foundation for a lifetime of growth.
