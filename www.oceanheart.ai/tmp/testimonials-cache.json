      "quote": "Rick is fantastic.I've been through wellbeing several times, all the previous times the practitioner were good.But Rick went down a different route to previous practitioners, instead of going down a medical route, he focused on a self acceptance and spiritual route, which fitted in well my faith (Christian).Before my first session I had a picture of a middle ages guy in a shirt and tie, Rick could not be further from that, here was a guy in a t-shirt with the sleeves cut off, muscles, more like a cool surfer guy.Me and Rick connected straight away, he made me feel relaxed and at ease.I want to thank Rick so much, because he has helped me find myself again.Having been discharged from wellbeing today, I can honestly say that though I'm happy about being discharged, I'm also sad that I won't get to have my weekly chats with him.",

I was referred for therapy to address my anxiety which was having a massively negative impact on my life.Whilst I was not an all out sceptic of holistic therapies, at the start I struggled to see how this therapy could or would be able to help me.",

He is a professional and a well mannered therapist, who was able to create a safe space emotionally and mentally so I could open up and speak. Especially as a trauma-informed therapist; he was sympathetic, empathic and non-judgemental in his approach.",
