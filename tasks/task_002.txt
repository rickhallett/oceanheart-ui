# Task ID: 2
# Title: Archive Saigo Feature
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Move all Saigo-related code to the archive directory while maintaining its structure
# Details:
Identify and move all Saigo-related code to `/archived/saigo/`. This includes: app pages from `/app/saigo/`, components used exclusively by Saigo, API routes like `/app/api/auth/saigo-callback/route.ts`, and related utility functions. Create subdirectories matching the original structure: `/app`, `/api`, `/components`, `/libs`, and `/migrations`. Document database tables and relationships in the README.md. Update any imports in active code that might reference these files.

# Test Strategy:
Verify all Saigo files are moved correctly. Check that no active code references the old file locations. Confirm the application builds without errors related to missing Saigo files.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Identify and map all Saigo-related code files [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a comprehensive mapping of all Saigo-related code files and their target locations in the archive directory
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Create a spreadsheet or document to track all Saigo-related files
2. Identify app pages in `/app/saigo/` directory
3. Identify API routes like `/app/api/auth/saigo-callback/route.ts`
4. Search for components used exclusively by Saigo (look for imports/usage patterns)
5. Identify utility functions and libraries specific to Saigo
6. For each file, document:
   - Current path
   - Target path in archive (maintaining structure)
   - Any active imports that reference this file
7. Verify the mapping is complete by checking for any missed dependencies

Testing approach:
- Manual verification that all Saigo-related files are identified
- Review the mapping with team members familiar with the codebase
- Ensure target paths maintain the original structure

## 2. Move files to archive directory and document database structure [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Move all identified Saigo-related files to the archive directory and document database tables and relationships
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Create the base archive directory structure at `/archived/saigo/`
2. Create subdirectories matching the original structure: `/app`, `/api`, `/components`, `/libs`, and `/migrations`
3. Move each file according to the mapping created in subtask 1
4. Verify file integrity after moving
5. Document database tables and relationships:
   - Create a README.md file in the `/archived/saigo/` directory
   - List all Saigo-related database tables
   - Document table schemas (column names, types, constraints)
   - Document relationships between tables
   - Include any relevant migration information

Testing approach:
- Verify all files are moved to correct locations
- Check that no files were corrupted during the move
- Validate the README.md contains complete database documentation
- Ensure the archive maintains the original directory structure

## 3. Update imports and verify application functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.2
### Description: Update any imports in active code that reference archived files and verify the application still functions correctly
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Using the mapping from subtask 1, identify all active code files that import Saigo-related code
2. For each affected file:
   - Remove or comment out imports to archived files
   - Update any conditional logic that depends on Saigo features
   - Consider adding comments indicating the code was removed due to archiving
3. Run the application locally to verify it builds successfully
4. Fix any build errors related to the archiving process
5. Test core application functionality to ensure nothing was broken
6. Update any relevant documentation or comments that reference Saigo features

Testing approach:
- Run automated tests to verify application functionality
- Manually test key application features
- Verify the application builds without errors
- Check for any runtime errors related to missing Saigo code
- Ensure no references to archived code remain in active codebase
