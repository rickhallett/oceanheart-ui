# Task ID: 4
# Title: Refactor Large Components
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Break down large components (LiveLeaderboard.tsx, Testimonials11.tsx, FeaturesListicle.tsx) into smaller, focused components.
# Details:
For each large component:
1. Identify logical sections that can be extracted
2. Create smaller components for each section
3. Ensure proper prop passing between components
4. Use composition to rebuild the original functionality

For LiveLeaderboard.tsx specifically:
- Extract LeaderboardHeader, LeaderboardRow, LeaderboardPagination as separate components
- Create a LeaderboardContext if state sharing is needed
- Move data fetching logic to a custom hook (useFetchLeaderboardData)

Follow similar patterns for Testimonials11.tsx and FeaturesListicle.tsx.

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests for each extracted component. Create integration tests for the composed components to ensure they function the same as the original large components. Perform visual regression testing to confirm UI appearance hasn't changed.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Refactor LiveLeaderboard.tsx [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Break down the LiveLeaderboard.tsx component into smaller, focused components and extract data fetching logic into a custom hook.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Create a useFetchLeaderboardData.ts hook that handles API calls and data manipulation
2. Extract LeaderboardHeader component with props for title, filters, and sorting options
3. Create LeaderboardRow component to display individual entries with props for user data, rank, and metrics
4. Build LeaderboardPagination component with pagination controls and state
5. Implement LeaderboardContext if multiple components need shared state access
6. Refactor the main LiveLeaderboard component to use these new components via composition
7. Test each component in isolation using mock data
8. Verify the refactored implementation matches the original functionality

Testing approach:
- Unit test each extracted component independently
- Test the custom hook with mock API responses
- Verify event handlers and state updates work correctly
- Ensure the refactored component renders identical output to the original

## 2. Refactor Testimonials11.tsx [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Decompose the Testimonials11.tsx component into smaller, reusable components with clear responsibilities.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Analyze the component structure to identify logical sections (e.g., TestimonialCard, TestimonialHeader, TestimonialCarousel)
2. Extract TestimonialCard component with props for quote, author, image, and rating
3. Create TestimonialHeader component for the section title and description
4. Build TestimonialCarousel/Navigation component if testimonials are displayed in a slider
5. Implement TestimonialContainer as the parent component that composes the smaller components
6. Ensure proper prop drilling or context usage for shared state
7. Maintain styling and responsive behavior across all components
8. Verify animations and transitions work correctly after refactoring

Testing approach:
- Test each component with various prop combinations
- Verify responsive layouts at different screen sizes
- Test any carousel/slider functionality
- Ensure accessibility attributes are preserved
- Compare visual output with the original component

## 3. Refactor FeaturesListicle.tsx [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Restructure the FeaturesListicle.tsx component into smaller, focused components that handle specific aspects of the feature display.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Identify distinct sections within the component (e.g., FeatureHeader, FeatureItem, FeatureList, FeatureCallToAction)
2. Extract FeatureHeader component for the section title and introductory content
3. Create FeatureItem component to display individual features with icons, titles, and descriptions
4. Build FeatureList component to manage the collection of FeatureItems
5. Extract FeatureCallToAction component if there's a CTA section
6. Refactor the main FeaturesListicle component to compose these smaller components
7. Ensure consistent styling and responsive behavior
8. Optimize for reusability across the application

Testing approach:
- Test each component with various content lengths and types
- Verify components handle edge cases (missing data, long text)
- Test responsive behavior at different breakpoints
- Ensure proper rendering of icons and images
- Compare the refactored component output with the original implementation
