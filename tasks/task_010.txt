# Task ID: 10
# Title: Final Testing and Performance Optimization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 9
# Priority: high
# Description: Comprehensive testing of all features and performance optimization
# Details:
Conduct end-to-end testing of all user flows. Optimize bundle size and load times through code splitting and lazy loading where appropriate. Run Lighthouse audits and address any performance, accessibility, or SEO issues. Verify that the refactored codebase meets all success criteria defined in the PRD: reduced line count, fewer similar components, improved code quality metrics, maintained or improved page load times, reduced bundle size, and better Lighthouse scores.

# Test Strategy:
Run comprehensive tests on all pages and features. Perform cross-browser testing. Measure performance metrics before and after optimization. Conduct accessibility testing. Compare final metrics against the success criteria defined in the PRD.

# Subtasks:
## 1. End-to-End Testing Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up and execute comprehensive end-to-end testing for all user flows to ensure application functionality remains intact after refactoring
### Details:
1. Define test scenarios covering all key user flows identified in the PRD
2. Implement end-to-end tests using Cypress or similar testing framework
3. Create test cases for happy paths and edge cases for each feature
4. Set up test data fixtures and mocks as needed
5. Implement test reporting to track test coverage and results
6. Run tests against the refactored codebase and document any failures
7. Fix any issues discovered during testing
8. Verify that all features work as expected after fixes
9. Testing approach: Compare test results against pre-refactoring baseline to ensure no regressions

## 2. Bundle Size and Load Time Optimization [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Implement code splitting, lazy loading, and other techniques to optimize bundle size and improve application load times
### Details:
1. Analyze current bundle size using webpack-bundle-analyzer or similar tool
2. Identify large dependencies and opportunities for code splitting
3. Implement React.lazy() and Suspense for component-level code splitting
4. Set up dynamic imports for route-based code splitting
5. Optimize image assets using compression and proper sizing
6. Implement resource hints (preload, prefetch) for critical resources
7. Configure proper caching strategies for static assets
8. Measure load time improvements using Chrome DevTools and Performance API
9. Testing approach: Compare bundle size and load times before and after optimization using metrics from webpack-bundle-analyzer and Lighthouse

## 3. Lighthouse Audit and Success Criteria Verification [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1, 10.2
### Description: Run Lighthouse audits to identify and fix performance, accessibility, and SEO issues, and verify that all success criteria from the PRD are met
### Details:
1. Run Lighthouse audits for Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, and SEO
2. Document all issues identified by Lighthouse
3. Prioritize and fix critical issues affecting performance scores
4. Implement accessibility improvements (ARIA attributes, color contrast, etc.)
5. Address SEO recommendations (meta tags, semantic HTML, etc.)
6. Verify all PRD success criteria are met:
   - Measure and compare code line count before and after refactoring
   - Count reduction in similar components
   - Run code quality metrics (complexity, maintainability)
   - Compare page load times before and after
   - Verify bundle size reduction
   - Compare Lighthouse scores
7. Create a final report documenting all improvements and metrics
8. Testing approach: Use before/after comparisons of all metrics to demonstrate improvements
