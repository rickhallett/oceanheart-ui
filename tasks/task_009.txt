# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement Redirects for Removed Routes
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7, 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create redirects for deprecated routes to maintain user experience
# Details:
Implement Next.js redirects in `next.config.js` for all deprecated routes, pointing to appropriate active pages. Create a custom 404 page that helps users find what they need. Update any internal links that might point to deprecated pages. Consider implementing a temporary banner on the homepage explaining any significant changes to returning users.

# Test Strategy:
Test all deprecated URLs to verify they redirect correctly. Check that the custom 404 page works and provides helpful navigation. Verify that search engine crawlers will understand the redirects (check HTTP status codes).

# Subtasks:
