# Task ID: 5
# Title: Refactor Feature Display Components
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Consolidate duplicate feature display and testimonial components
# Details:
Consolidate `FeaturesGrid.tsx`, `FeaturesListicle.tsx`, and `FeaturesAccordion.tsx` into a single component with different layout options controlled by props. Refactor testimonial components into a unified system. Evaluate and potentially consolidate `KnowledgeGapSection.tsx` and `CompoundingHoursSection.tsx`. Create a generic section component pattern for consistency. Update all imports to reference the new consolidated components.

# Test Strategy:
Compare visual appearance before and after refactoring to ensure consistency. Test all layout options of the consolidated components. Verify responsive behavior on different screen sizes.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create consolidated FeatureDisplay component with layout options [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Consolidate the three feature display components into a single unified component that supports different layout styles through props
### Details:
1. Create a new component called `FeatureDisplay.tsx` in the appropriate directory
2. Analyze the common elements across `FeaturesGrid.tsx`, `FeaturesListicle.tsx`, and `FeaturesAccordion.tsx`
3. Define a TypeScript interface for the component props that includes a `layout` prop with values 'grid', 'listicle', or 'accordion'
4. Implement the core feature display logic that is shared across all layouts
5. Create separate rendering functions for each layout type
6. Use conditional rendering based on the `layout` prop to determine which layout to display
7. Ensure all existing props from the original components are supported
8. Add appropriate TypeScript types for all props and internal functions
9. Test the component with each layout type to ensure it matches the original components' functionality
10. Document the component API with JSDoc comments

## 2. Create unified testimonial component system [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Refactor all testimonial components into a cohesive system with shared styling and behavior
### Details:
1. Identify all testimonial-related components in the codebase
2. Analyze their common patterns, styles, and functionality
3. Create a base `Testimonial.tsx` component that handles core testimonial display logic
4. Create variations or layout options as needed (e.g., single testimonial, carousel, grid)
5. Define a consistent props interface that works across all testimonial display types
6. Extract shared styling into a common styles file or styled components
7. Implement responsive behavior that works across all testimonial layouts
8. Add appropriate animation or transition effects where needed
9. Ensure accessibility features are implemented (proper ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation)
10. Test all testimonial layouts on different screen sizes
11. Document the component API with usage examples

## 3. Create generic section component and update imports [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1, 5.2
### Description: Develop a generic section component pattern, evaluate specialized sections for consolidation, and update all imports throughout the codebase
### Details:
1. Create a `GenericSection.tsx` component that can serve as a base for all section layouts
2. Define props for common section elements (title, subtitle, background, padding, etc.)
3. Analyze `KnowledgeGapSection.tsx` and `CompoundingHoursSection.tsx` to determine if they can be consolidated
4. If possible, refactor these specialized sections to use the generic section component with specific props
5. Create a migration plan for updating imports across the codebase
6. Update all imports that referenced the original components to use the new consolidated components
7. Create a mapping between old component props and new component props if needed
8. Test all affected pages to ensure they render correctly with the new components
9. Check for any regressions in responsive behavior or animations
10. Document the migration process and new component structure for other developers
11. Create examples of how to use the new generic section pattern for future development
