# Task ID: 1
# Title: Create Archive Directory Structure
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up the initial archive directory structure and documentation for deprecated code
# Details:
Create the `/archived` top-level directory with subdirectories for each deprecated feature: `/archived/saigo`, `/archived/hdi`, and `/archived/ab-testing`. Add README.md files in each directory explaining the archival approach and the purpose of each feature. Set up documentation templates for tracking what has been moved and why. This task establishes the foundation for the entire refactoring process.

# Test Strategy:
Verify directory structure exists with proper permissions. Confirm README files are created with appropriate documentation templates. No functional testing required for this task.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create base archive directory structure [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up the top-level `/archived` directory and feature-specific subdirectories in the project repository
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Create the top-level `/archived` directory at the root of the project repository
2. Create the three feature-specific subdirectories: `/archived/saigo`, `/archived/hdi`, and `/archived/ab-testing`
3. Set up a basic `.gitignore` file in the `/archived` directory if needed
4. Create an empty placeholder file in each directory to ensure the directories are tracked by git
5. Verify the directory structure is properly created and accessible

Testing approach:
- Manually verify the directories exist and have correct permissions
- Ensure the directories are properly tracked in version control

## 2. Create README documentation for archived directories [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Create comprehensive README.md files for each archived directory explaining the archival approach and feature purpose
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Create a main `/archived/README.md` file that explains:
   - The purpose of the archive directory
   - The general archival process and guidelines
   - How to find and use archived code
   - When and how code should be completely removed vs archived
2. Create feature-specific README files in each subdirectory:
   - `/archived/saigo/README.md`: Document the Saigo feature purpose, why it was deprecated, and key components
   - `/archived/hdi/README.md`: Document the HDI feature purpose, why it was deprecated, and key components
   - `/archived/ab-testing/README.md`: Document the AB Testing feature purpose, why it was deprecated, and key components
3. Include in each feature README: original location of code, key developers, and potential future use cases

Testing approach:
- Review the documentation for clarity and completeness
- Have another team member review the documentation for accuracy

## 3. Create archival tracking templates and process documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1, 1.2
### Description: Develop templates and tracking mechanisms for documenting what code has been moved to the archive
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Create an `/archived/TEMPLATE.md` file with standardized sections for:
   - Feature name and description
   - Original location in codebase
   - Reason for deprecation/archival
   - Date of archival
   - Dependencies and potential impact
   - Responsible developers
   - Reuse considerations
2. Create an `/archived/tracking.csv` or similar structured file to track all archived components with columns for:
   - Component name
   - Original path
   - New archived path
   - Date archived
   - Archived by (developer)
   - Ticket/issue reference
3. Document the archival process in `/archived/PROCESS.md` including:
   - Steps to properly archive code
   - Review requirements before archiving
   - How to update the tracking document
   - Guidelines for when to archive vs. delete

Testing approach:
- Test the templates by creating a sample entry
- Review with team members to ensure the tracking approach meets project needs
- Verify the process documentation is clear and actionable
