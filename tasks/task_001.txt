And uh, okay, yep. Subtask 1.2. Continue. create a detailed PRD document overlooking all of those from a high level architectural point of view okay and make sure you consider the pros and cons of each before any implementations general observations are welcome and fine don't move to api routes until you got that down # Task ID: 1
# Title: Perform Comprehensive Codebase Analysis
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Conduct a thorough analysis of the codebase to identify specific components, APIs, and code areas requiring refactoring.
# Details:
Create a detailed inventory of:
1. All components in the flat structure (40+ components)
2. Large components that need breaking down (LiveLeaderboard.tsx, Testimonials11.tsx, FeaturesListicle.tsx)
3. API routes with inconsistent patterns
4. Usage of 'any' type throughout the codebase
5. State management patterns and SWR usage
6. Dead code and outdated dependencies

Use tools like `npx depcheck` for dependency analysis and TypeScript's project references to identify type issues. Document findings in a structured format for reference during implementation phases.

# Test Strategy:
Create a comprehensive report with metrics including:
- Component count and size distribution
- TypeScript 'any' usage count
- API route patterns
- Dependency age analysis
- Code duplication percentage
This report will serve as the baseline for measuring refactoring progress.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Component and API Route Inventory [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Catalog all components and API routes in the codebase with metadata about size, complexity, and patterns
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Create a script to scan the codebase and identify all React components (look for .tsx files with component exports)
2. For each component, record: file path, size (LOC), number of props, external dependencies, and render complexity
3. Specifically flag the mentioned large components (LiveLeaderboard.tsx, Testimonials11.tsx, FeaturesListicle.tsx) with detailed notes on their structure
4. Scan all API routes and document their patterns, parameters, and response formats
5. Identify inconsistent API naming conventions or implementation patterns
6. Store all findings in a structured JSON format for easy reference
7. Generate a summary report highlighting the most problematic areas

Testing approach: Validate the inventory by cross-checking against directory listings and ensuring no components or routes are missed. Have another team member review the findings for accuracy.

## 2. Analyze TypeScript Usage and Type Issues [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Perform a comprehensive analysis of TypeScript implementation, focusing on 'any' type usage and type-related code smells
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Use the TypeScript compiler API to programmatically analyze the codebase for type issues
2. Create a custom linting rule or script to identify all instances of 'any' type usage
3. Categorize 'any' usages by context: API responses, props, state management, utility functions, etc.
4. Run TypeScript in strict mode temporarily to identify potential type errors
5. Analyze component prop interfaces for consistency and completeness
6. Document findings with file locations, severity levels, and suggested fixes
7. Prioritize issues based on risk and implementation complexity

Testing approach: Verify findings by manually checking a sample of identified issues. Create a test plan for validating type improvements in future refactoring work.

## 3. Evaluate Dependencies and State Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1, 1.2
### Description: Analyze current dependencies, state management patterns, and identify dead code across the application
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Run `npx depcheck` to identify unused dependencies in package.json
2. Analyze dependency versions for outdated packages using `npm outdated`
3. Create a dependency graph to visualize package relationships and identify potential consolidation opportunities
4. Document all state management approaches currently in use (SWR, Context API, Redux, local state)
5. Analyze SWR implementation patterns for consistency and efficiency
6. Use a code coverage tool on the test suite to identify potentially dead code
7. Implement a custom script to detect unused components, functions, and imports
8. Create a comprehensive report with recommended actions for each issue

Testing approach: Validate dependency findings by attempting to remove suspected unused dependencies in a branch and running the test suite. Verify state management analysis by tracing state flow in key application features.
