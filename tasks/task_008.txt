# Task ID: 8
# Title: Remove Unused and Commented Code
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: low
# Description: Clean up commented-out code and unused components
# Details:
Remove commented code blocks in `/libs/instagram-service.ts`, `/libs/gpt.ts`, and various components. Identify and archive components that have no imports anywhere in the codebase. Clean up TODOs and other code comments that are no longer relevant. Focus on improving code readability and maintainability without affecting functionality.

# Test Strategy:
Verify the application builds without errors. Run existing tests to ensure functionality is preserved. Check that bundle size is reduced after removing unused code.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Remove Commented Code from Service Files [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Clean up commented-out code blocks in the service files to improve readability and maintainability
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Scan through `/libs/instagram-service.ts` and `/libs/gpt.ts` to identify commented-out code blocks
2. For each commented block, evaluate if it contains any useful information that should be preserved in documentation
3. Remove all commented-out code that is no longer needed
4. If any commented code contains important information about implementation choices, convert it to proper JSDoc comments
5. Remove outdated TODOs and irrelevant comments
6. Run tests to ensure services still function correctly after cleanup

Testing approach:
- Run the existing test suite for these services
- Manually verify that all service functionality works as expected
- Ensure no regressions in the application's behavior

## 2. Clean Up Component Files and Remove Commented Code [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Identify and clean up commented code and outdated TODOs in component files throughout the codebase
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Create a list of all component files in the codebase
2. Systematically review each component file to identify:
   - Commented-out code blocks
   - Outdated TODOs
   - Irrelevant comments
3. For each identified item:
   - Evaluate if it contains useful information
   - Remove if no longer needed
   - Convert important information to proper documentation
4. Focus on React components, ensuring any removed code doesn't affect component functionality
5. Update any comments that are still relevant but need clarification

Testing approach:
- After cleaning each component, render it to ensure it still functions correctly
- Check that component props and behavior remain unchanged
- Run the application to verify visual and functional integrity

## 3. Identify and Archive Unused Components [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.2
### Description: Find components that have no imports anywhere in the codebase and archive them appropriately
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Create a script or use a code analysis tool to identify all component files in the codebase
2. For each component, search the entire codebase for imports of that component
3. Create a list of components with zero imports
4. Verify each potentially unused component:
   - Confirm it's not dynamically imported
   - Check it's not referenced in a way the static analysis missed
5. Create an 'archived' directory to store unused components instead of deleting them immediately
6. Move verified unused components to the archive with a comment indicating when and why they were archived
7. Update any relevant documentation to reflect the component changes

Testing approach:
- After archiving components, run the full test suite
- Perform a comprehensive smoke test of the application
- Verify no console errors appear related to missing components
- Ensure the application builds successfully without the removed components
