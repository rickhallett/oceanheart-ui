- **Structured tagging**: Custom XML-style sections to keep context organized.
- **Clear roles/goals**: Defined identity, mission, and tasks reduce ambiguity.
- **Data priming**: Embedded structured client data for consistent context.
- **Schema adherence**: Stable internal fields for updates over time.
- **Step sequencing**: Ordered instructions for initialization and use.
- **Question strategy**: Heuristics for spotting gaps and asking targeted questions.
- **Command patterns**: Predictable triggers and output formats.
- **Guardrails**: Simple rules to stay on task and restore focus.
