# Task ID: 17
# Title: Remove Dead and Unused Code
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: low
# Description: Identify and remove dead code, unused imports, and unnecessary dependencies from the codebase.
# Details:
1. Use ESLint to identify unused imports and variables:
```bash
npx eslint --fix "**/*.{ts,tsx}"
```

2. Configure ESLint rules for unused code:
```json
// .eslintrc.json
{
  "rules": {
    "no-unused-vars": "error",
    "no-unused-expressions": "error",
    "import/no-unused-modules": "error"
  }
}
```

3. Use tools to find unused files:
```bash
npx depcheck
```

4. Analyze bundle size to identify unnecessary dependencies:
```bash
npx next build
npx next analyze
```

5. Remove identified dead code and unused dependencies:
- Delete unused files
- Remove unused imports
- Uninstall unnecessary dependencies
- Remove unused functions and components

# Test Strategy:
Run the application thoroughly after removing code to ensure no functionality is broken. Use code coverage tools to identify untested code that might be candidates for removal. Monitor bundle size before and after cleanup to measure improvement.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Analyze and list unused dependencies [in-progress]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Run dependency checking tools to identify unused packages in the project
### Details:
1. Run `npx depcheck` to scan the project
2. Capture the raw output in a markdown file
3. Create a table listing each unused dependency, its version, and potential impact of removal
4. Check package.json for dev dependencies that might be consolidated or removed
5. Document any dependencies that appear unused but might have side effects if removed

## 2. Configure and run ESLint for unused code detection [in-progress]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up and execute ESLint with specific rules to detect unused variables, imports, and expressions throughout the codebase
### Details:
1. Update .eslintrc.json with the rules specified in the task description
2. Add additional rules for detecting dead code patterns:
   - `no-unreachable`: to detect unreachable code
   - `import/no-unused-modules`: to detect unused exports
3. Run ESLint across the entire codebase: `npx eslint --fix "**/*.{ts,tsx}" > unused-code-report.txt`
4. Parse the output to create a structured list of files with unused code elements
5. Categorize findings by type (unused imports, variables, expressions)

1. Update .eslintrc.json with the rules specified in the task description\n2. Add additional rules for detecting dead code patterns:\n   - `no-unreachable`: to detect unreachable code\n   - `import/no-unused-modules`: to detect unused exports\n3. Run ESLint across the entire codebase: `npx eslint --fix \"**/*.{ts,tsx}\" > unused-code-report.txt`\n4. Parse the output to create a structured list of files with unused code elements\n5. Categorize findings by type (unused imports, variables, expressions)\n\nUpdate: The project is using ESLint v9+, which requires a flat config format with `eslint.config.js` instead of the legacy `.eslintrc.json`. To proceed:\n\n1. Create a new `eslint.config.js` file in the project root with the following structure:\n```javascript\nimport js from '@eslint/js';\nimport tseslint from 'typescript-eslint';\n\nexport default [\n  js.configs.recommended,\n  ...tseslint.configs.recommended,\n  {\n    rules: {\n      'no-unused-vars': 'error',\n      'no-unreachable': 'error',\n    },\n    linterOptions: {\n      reportUnusedDisableDirectives: true,\n    },\n  },\n];\n```\n\n2. Install any missing dependencies:\n```bash\nnpm install -D @eslint/js typescript-eslint\n```\n\n3. If needed, use the official ESLint migration tool to help with the transition:\n```bash\nnpx eslint-migrate-config .eslintrc.json\n```\n\n4. After migration, add the specific rules for dead code detection to the config\n\n5. Run ESLint with the new configuration:\n```bash\nnpx eslint --fix \"**/*.{ts,tsx}\" > unused-code-report.txt\n```\n\n6. Continue with the original plan to parse and categorize the findings

## 3. Analyze bundle for unused code and large modules [in-progress]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Use Next.js build tools to analyze the application bundle and identify potentially unused or oversized modules
### Details:
1. Run `npx next build` to generate production build
2. Execute `npx next analyze` to generate bundle analysis
3. Examine the bundle visualization to identify:
   - Unusually large modules that could be optimized
   - Modules that appear in the bundle but shouldn't be needed
   - Duplicate dependencies
4. Document findings with screenshots of the bundle analysis
5. Create a list of specific modules to investigate further

## 4. Perform heuristic search for unreferenced code [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Use code search tools to identify potentially unused files, components, and functions that might not be detected by static analysis
### Details:
1. Use grep or similar tools to find files that aren't imported anywhere:
   `find src -type f -name "*.tsx" | xargs -I{} sh -c 'grep -l "import.*from.*$(basename {} .tsx)" src --include="*.{ts,tsx}" || echo {}'`
2. Search for exported functions/components with low usage counts
3. Identify utility functions that might be duplicated or obsolete
4. Look for commented-out code blocks that should be removed
5. Document all findings in a structured format with file paths and line numbers

## 5. Compile consolidated zombie code report [pending]
### Dependencies: 17.1, 17.2, 17.3, 17.4
### Description: Gather and organize all findings from previous subtasks into a comprehensive report of potential dead code for review
### Details:
1. Create a single markdown document with sections for each type of unused code:
   - Unused npm dependencies
   - Unused imports and variables
   - Unreferenced files and components
   - Large/inefficient bundle modules
   - Commented-out code blocks
2. For each item, include:
   - Location (file path, line numbers)
   - Type of issue
   - Confidence level (high/medium/low)
   - Potential impact of removal
3. Add summary statistics at the top of the report
4. Include recommendations for prioritization

## 6. Remove confirmed dead code [pending]
### Dependencies: 17.5
### Description: Systematically remove the dead code identified and confirmed in the previous steps
### Details:
1. Create a new git branch for the cleanup
2. Implement removals in the following order:
   - Unused imports and variables (can often be auto-fixed with ESLint)
   - Unreferenced functions and components
   - Entire unused files
   - Unnecessary npm dependencies (update package.json and lock files)
3. After each significant removal, run the test suite and verify the application still works
4. Update any documentation that referenced removed code
5. Create a PR with before/after bundle size comparisons
