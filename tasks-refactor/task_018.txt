# Task ID: 18
# Title: Update Outdated Dependencies
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 17
# Priority: medium
# Description: Identify and update outdated dependencies to their latest compatible versions.
# Details:
1. Check for outdated dependencies:
```bash
npm outdated
```

2. Update dependencies one at a time, testing after each update:
```bash
npm update dependency-name
```

3. For major version updates, check migration guides and make necessary code changes.

4. Update Next.js and React carefully, following their migration guides:
- [Next.js Upgrade Guide](https://nextjs.org/docs/upgrading)
- [React Upgrade Guide](https://react.dev/blog/2023/03/16/introducing-react-dev)

5. Update TypeScript and adjust code for any breaking changes:
```bash
npm install typescript@latest
```

6. Create a dependency update strategy for the future:
- Regular scheduled updates
- Automated dependency updates with tools like Dependabot
- Security vulnerability monitoring

# Test Strategy:
Run the full test suite after each significant dependency update. Perform manual testing of key features after updates. Monitor for any performance regressions or visual changes. Create a rollback plan in case updates cause unexpected issues.
