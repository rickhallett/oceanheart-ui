# Task ID: 3
# Title: Extract Reusable UI Components
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Identify and extract common UI patterns into reusable components to be placed in the UI subdirectory.
# Details:
1. Create base UI components such as Button, Modal, Card, Input, etc.
2. Ensure each component has proper TypeScript interfaces for props
3. Implement variants using Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI
4. Add proper documentation for each component

Example Button component structure:
```tsx
interface ButtonProps {
  variant?: 'primary' | 'secondary' | 'outline' | 'ghost';
  size?: 'sm' | 'md' | 'lg';
  isLoading?: boolean;
  disabled?: boolean;
  onClick?: () => void;
  children: React.ReactNode;
  className?: string;
}

export const Button: React.FC<ButtonProps> = ({
  variant = 'primary',
  size = 'md',
  isLoading = false,
  disabled = false,
  onClick,
  children,
  className = '',
}) => {
  // Component implementation
};
```

# Test Strategy:
Create a Storybook instance to document and test UI components in isolation. Write unit tests for each component using React Testing Library to verify proper rendering and behavior for different prop combinations.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Essential UI Base Components [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement the core UI components that will serve as the foundation for the application interface. This includes Button, Input, Card, and Modal components.
### Details:
1. Create a UI directory structure with subdirectories for each component type
2. Implement the Button component as shown in the example with proper TypeScript interfaces
3. Create the Input component with variants for text, number, password, etc.
4. Implement the Card component with options for headers, footers, and content areas
5. Build the Modal component with customizable header, body, and footer sections
6. Ensure all components use Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI for styling
7. Add basic unit tests for each component using React Testing Library
8. Test each component in isolation to verify proper rendering and behavior
9. Add JSDoc comments to document component props and usage

## 2. Implement Advanced UI Components and Variants [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Extend the component library with more advanced UI elements and add variants to existing components to support different use cases.
### Details:
1. Build on the base components to create Dropdown, Tabs, Toggle, and Tooltip components
2. Add additional variants to existing components (e.g., danger/success buttons, outlined cards)
3. Implement loading states for interactive components
4. Create compound components where needed (e.g., Form.Group, Form.Label, Form.Input)
5. Ensure responsive behavior for all components using Tailwind's responsive classes
6. Implement accessibility features (ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation)
7. Add unit tests for all new components and variants
8. Test component interactions and state changes
9. Ensure TypeScript interfaces are comprehensive and allow for extension

## 3. Create Component Documentation and Storybook Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1, 3.2
### Description: Document all components and integrate with Storybook to provide a comprehensive component library reference for developers.
### Details:
1. Install and configure Storybook in the project
2. Create stories for each component showing different variants and states
3. Write comprehensive usage documentation with code examples
4. Document prop interfaces and default values in a standardized format
5. Create a README.md file for each component with usage instructions
6. Add controls to Storybook stories to allow interactive testing of props
7. Include accessibility information and best practices in the documentation
8. Create example compositions showing how components work together
9. Add visual regression tests using Storybook's snapshot capability
10. Ensure documentation includes edge cases and limitations of each component
