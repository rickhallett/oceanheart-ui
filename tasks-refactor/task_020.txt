# Task ID: 20
# Title: Improve Documentation and Comments
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19
# Priority: medium
# Description: Enhance code documentation, add JSDoc comments, and create developer guides for the refactored codebase.
# Details:
1. Add JSDoc comments to functions and components:
```typescript
/**
 * Fetches user data from the API
 * @param userId - The ID of the user to fetch
 * @returns A promise that resolves to the user data
 * @throws Will throw an error if the user is not found
 */
async function fetchUser(userId: string): Promise<User> {
  // Implementation
}
```

2. Create README files for major directories:
```
components/README.md
lib/README.md
hooks/README.md
```

3. Create a developer guide in the project root:
```
DEVELOPER.md
```

4. Document architectural decisions:
```
docs/architecture/
  component-structure.md
  state-management.md
  api-patterns.md
```

5. Create onboarding documentation for new developers:
```
docs/onboarding.md
```

6. Add inline comments for complex logic:
```typescript
// This algorithm uses a modified version of binary search
// to efficiently find the closest match in the sorted array
function findClosestMatch(array, target) {
  // Implementation with comments explaining each step
}
```

# Test Strategy:
Review documentation for completeness and accuracy. Create a checklist for documentation standards. Have team members review documentation for clarity and usefulness. Set up a process for keeping documentation updated as the codebase evolves.
