# OceanHeart.ai Landing Page Redesign PRD

## Project Overview
This document outlines the requirements for redesigning the OceanHeart.ai landing page and implementing A/B testing for four headline variations. The current site focuses heavily on AI Safety, Consciousness, and AGI with a philosophical tone. The redesign aims to reposition the site towards human-centric AI coaching.

## Goals & Objectives
- Shift positioning from abstract AI concepts to practical AI coaching
- Test four headline options to determine the most effective messaging
- Create a more direct and clear value proposition for visitors
- Improve conversion rate for the "Schedule a Call" CTA

## Requirements

### 1. A/B Testing Implementation

- Maintain the same "What I Do" section across all variants
- Use the same CTA across all variants, but track which variant led to the conversion
- Distribute traffic equally among the 4 variants (25% each)
- Track click-through rates and conversion rates for each variant
- Testing duration: 2 weeks or until statistical significance is reached
