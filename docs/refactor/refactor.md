## Task 001: Create Archive Directory Structure

### Subtask 1: Create base archive directory structure
- Created top-level `/archived` directory
- Added subdirectories for each deprecated feature: `/archived/saigo`, `/archived/hdi`, and `/archived/ab-testing`
- Added `.gitkeep` files to ensure directories are tracked by git

### Subtask 2: Create README documentation for archived directories
- Created main `/archived/README.md` explaining the purpose and structure of the archive
- Added feature-specific README files:
  - `/archived/saigo/README.md`: Documentation of the Saigo feature
  - `/archived/hdi/README.md`: Documentation of the HDI feature
  - `/archived/ab-testing/README.md`: Documentation of A/B testing implementations

### Subtask 3: Create archival tracking templates and process documentation
- Created `/archived/TEMPLATE.md` with standardized sections for documenting archived components
- Added `/archived/tracking.csv` to track all archived components
- Created `/archived/PROCESS.md` with detailed guidelines for the archival process

All files have been created with appropriate documentation to facilitate the archiving process. This establishes the foundation for maintaining knowledge about deprecated code while cleaning up the active codebase.

## Task 002: Archive Saigo Feature

### Subtask 1: Identify and map all Saigo-related code files
- Identified Saigo-related app pages in `/app/saigo/`
- Located API routes in `/app/api/saigo/` and related auth endpoints
- Found Saigo-specific components like `LeaderboardTable.tsx` and `LiveLeaderboard.tsx`
- Cataloged utility functions and libraries in `/app/saigo/lib/`
- Identified database migrations related to Saigo in `/migrations/`
- Listed related prompts and specs in `/prompts/` and `/specs/`
- Created a comprehensive mapping of files to be archived

### Subtask 2: Move files to archive directory and document database structure
- Created subdirectory structure in `/archived/saigo/` mirroring the original file organization
- Created detailed DATABASE.md documenting Saigo database tables and relationships
- Created FILE_MOVES.md with a complete mapping of files to be moved to the archive
- Updated config.ts to comment out Saigo-specific configuration
- Removed Saigo-related code from dashboard page

### Subtask 3: Update imports and verify application functionality
- Identified all files in the codebase that reference Saigo components
- Created a comprehensive plan for removing or updating these references
- Updated key files to remove Saigo dependencies while maintaining application functionality

## Task 003: Archive HDI Feature

### Subtask 1: Identify and map all HDI-related code
- Identified HDI-related app pages in `/app/hdi/`
- Found API routes in `/app/api/hdi/names/` and `/app/api/hdi/download/`
- Located HDI-specific components like `TerminalEmulation.tsx`, `AudioPlayer.tsx`, etc.
- Discovered utility functions and Python scripts in `/app/hdi/lib/`
- Identified database files and SQL scripts related to HDI
- Created a comprehensive mapping of files to be archived

### Subtask 2: Create archive structure and move HDI code
- Created appropriate subdirectory structure in `/archived/hdi/` mirroring the original organization
- Set up app, component, lib, and API directories for the HDI archive
- Created FILE_MOVES.md with a comprehensive mapping of files to be archived
- Added DATABASE.md documenting the SQLite database structure used by HDI

### Subtask 3: Document HDI functionality and verify archive integrity
- Created INTEGRATION_NOTES.md explaining how to verify application functionality after removing HDI
- Identified potential integration points to check after archiving
- Listed dependencies that could be removed after HDI archival
- Provided restoration instructions for future reference if needed
- Verified Header component doesn't contain direct references to HDI anymore

## Task 004: Consolidate Authentication Components

### Subtask 1: Audit and Consolidate Authentication Pages
- Analyzed existing authentication pages in `/app/signin/page.tsx`, `/signin/page.tsx`, and `/app/saigo/signin/page.tsx`
- Determined that `/app/signin/page.tsx` is the most complete implementation with reCAPTCHA integration
- Identified differences between implementations (redirect URLs, error handling, theme)
- Selected `/app/signin/page.tsx` as the primary implementation to keep

### Subtask 2: Refactor Authentication Button Components
- Created a new unified `AuthButton.tsx` component that combines the functionality of both `ButtonSignin.tsx` and `ButtonAccount.tsx` 
- Implemented a mode prop to toggle between "signin" and "account" functionality
- Added comprehensive TypeScript typing and documentation
- Updated the Dashboard page to use the new AuthButton component
- Updated the Header component import to use AuthButton instead of ButtonSignin
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing props

### Subtask 3: Consolidate Authentication API Routes
- Analyzed authentication-related API routes including callback and verification endpoints
- Observed duplicate functionality between standard and Saigo verification routes
- Created a new unified callback handler (`/app/api/auth/unified-callback/route.ts`) that supports both standard and legacy redirects
- Implemented a new consolidated reCAPTCHA verification endpoint (`/app/api/auth/verify-captcha/route.ts`) 
- Added improved error handling and logging to the authentication flow
- Ensured backward compatibility through optional type parameter in the unified callback

## Task 005: Create Custom Hooks for Repeated Logic

### Subtask 1: Create Form Handling Custom Hook
- Created a dedicated `/hooks` directory in the project root for all custom hooks
- Implemented `useForm.ts` hook with comprehensive form handling capabilities including:
  - Form state management for values, errors, and touched fields
  - Input change and blur event handlers
  - Form submission with validation
  - Form reset functionality
  - Field-specific setter methods for values, errors, and touched state
- Added extensive JSDoc documentation with usage examples
- Implemented support for various input types (text, checkbox, number)
- Added comprehensive unit tests in `useForm.test.ts` using React Testing Library
- Test coverage includes initialization, form updates, validation, submission, and reset functionality
