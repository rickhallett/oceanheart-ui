# Example Cursor AI Interactions

Here are some common interactions with Cursor AI when using Task Master:

## Starting a new project

```
I've just initialized a new project with Claude Task Master. I have a PRD at scripts/prd.txt.
Can you help me parse it and set up the initial tasks?
```

## Working on tasks

```
What's the next task I should work on? Please consider dependencies and priorities.
```

## Implementing a specific task

```
I'd like to implement task 4. Can you help me understand what needs to be done and how to approach it?
```

## Managing subtasks

```
I need to regenerate the subtasks for task 3 with a different approach. Can you help me clear and regenerate them?
```

## Handling changes

```
We've decided to use MongoDB instead of PostgreSQL. Can you update all future tasks to reflect this change?
```

## Completing work

```
I've finished implementing the authentication system described in task 2. All tests are passing.
Please mark it as complete and tell me what I should work on next.
```

## Analyzing complexity

```
Can you analyze the complexity of our tasks to help me understand which ones need to be broken down further?
```

## Viewing complexity report

```
Can you show me the complexity report in a more readable format?
```
