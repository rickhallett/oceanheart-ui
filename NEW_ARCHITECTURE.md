### Key Directory Explanations

#### `app/` Directory

The `app/` directory follows the Next.js App Router pattern where each subdirectory represents a route in the application. Key subdirectories include:

- **`api/`**: Server-side API routes
  - **`auth/`**: Authentication-related endpoints
  - **`stripe/`**: Payment processing endpoints
  - **`webhook/`**: Webhook handlers for external services

- **Page Routes**: Each subdirectory typically contains:
  - **`page.tsx`**: The React component for the page
  - **`layout.tsx`**: (Optional) Layout wrapper for the page
  - **Other components**: Page-specific components

#### `components/` Directory

Contains reusable React components used throughout the application. These are organized in a flat structure with related components grouped together by functionality.

#### `hooks/` Directory

Contains custom React hooks that encapsulate reusable logic:

- **`useForm.ts`**: A hook for form state management, validation, and submission
- Additional hooks will be implemented for authentication, data fetching, etc.

#### `libs/` Directory

Contains service integrations and utility functions:

- **`api.ts`**: Utility functions for making API calls
- **`stripe.ts`**: Stripe payment integration
- **`supabase/`**: Supabase client configuration and helper functions

## Core Application Flow

1. **Request Handling**:
   - Incoming requests first pass through `middleware.ts`
   - Middleware handles authentication checks and redirects
   - Next.js routes the request to the appropriate page or API endpoint

2. **Page Rendering**:
   - Pages in the `app/` directory render server-side by default
   - Client components are marked with `"use client";` directive
   - Layout components provide consistent structure

3. **Data Fetching**:
   - Server components fetch data on the server
   - Client components use SWR or custom hooks for data fetching
   - API routes handle data mutation operations

4. **Component Hierarchy**:
   - Layouts define the overall page structure
   - Pages compose reusable components
   - Components use custom hooks for state and side effects

## Authentication System

Authentication is handled through Supabase Authentication:

1. **Sign-in Flow**:
   - User navigates to `/signin`
   - Authentication options include Email Magic Link and Google OAuth
   - reCAPTCHA verifies human users
   - Authentication redirects to appropriate callback handlers

2. **Authentication State**:
   - Supabase client manages session state
   - Middleware checks auth state for protected routes
   - `AuthButton` component adapts based on auth state

3. **Protected Routes**:
   - Middleware redirects unauthenticated users
   - Dashboard and user-specific pages check auth state

## State Management

1. **Server State**:
   - Fetched directly in server components
   - Passed down as props to client components

2. **Client State**:
   - Local component state using React's `useState`
   - Form state managed through the `useForm` custom hook
   - Session state managed through Supabase

3. **Data Fetching**:
   - SWR for client-side data fetching with caching and revalidation
   - Custom API utilities for specific data operations

## Database & API Integration

1. **Supabase**:
   - Primary database is PostgreSQL hosted on Supabase
   - Authentication via Supabase Auth
   - Data access through Supabase client

2. **API Routes**:
   - Next.js API routes in the `app/api/` directory
   - Endpoints for authentication, data operations, and third-party integrations
   - Webhook handlers for external services

3. **External Services**:
   - Stripe for payment processing
   - Resend for email delivery
   - OpenAI for AI conversation features

## Custom Hooks

Custom hooks encapsulate reusable logic:

1. **`useForm`**:
   - Form state management
   - Validation
   - Submission handling
   - Error management

2. **Future Hooks**:
   - Authentication state management
   - Data fetching
   - Animation controls

## Component Architecture

1. **Layout Components**:
   - `app/layout.tsx`: Root layout with global elements
   - Feature-specific layouts (e.g., `app/blog/layout.tsx`)

2. **Page Components**:
   - Implement specific routes
   - Compose shared components
   - Handle page-specific logic

3. **UI Components**:
   - Reusable UI elements in `components/` directory
   - Follow consistent naming and prop patterns
   - Use Tailwind CSS for styling

4. **Feature Components**:
   - Specialized components for specific features
   - Located in feature-specific directories or in `components/`

## Styling

1. **Tailwind CSS**:
   - Primary styling approach
   - Configuration in `tailwind.config.js`
   - Global styles in `app/globals.css`

2. **DaisyUI**:
   - Component library built on Tailwind
   - Provides pre-styled UI elements

3. **Framer Motion**:
   - Animation library for interactive elements
   - Used for page transitions and UI animations

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**:
   - Jest for testing utility functions and hooks
   - React Testing Library for component testing

2. **End-to-End Tests**:
   - Cypress for testing full user flows
   - Coverage of critical paths like authentication and checkout

3. **Test Files**:
   - Located alongside the code they test with `.test.ts` or `.test.tsx` extension
   - Custom hooks have corresponding test files (e.g., `useForm.test.ts`)

## Deployment

The application is deployed on Vercel with the following environment considerations:

1. **Environment Variables**:
   - Stored securely in Vercel
   - Local development uses `.env.local`

2. **Build Process**:
   - Automated through Vercel's integration with GitHub
   - Includes linting, type checking, and testing

3. **Preview Deployments**:
   - Generated for pull requests
   - Allow testing changes before merging

## Developer Workflow

1. **Local Development**:
   - Clone repository and install dependencies
   - Set up environment variables
   - Run development server with `bun dev`

2. **Code Organization**:
   - Follow Next.js App Router conventions
   - Keep components focused and reusable
   - Use custom hooks for shared logic

3. **Build and Verification**:
   - Run linting with `bun lint`
   - Check types with `bun typecheck`
   - Run tests with `bun test`
   - Build locally with `bun build`

4. **Contribution**:
   - Follow the established patterns in the codebase
   - Update documentation for significant changes
   - Use feature branches and pull requests
