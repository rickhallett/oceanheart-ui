# Saigo Users Table Insertion Specification
> Ingest the information from this file and implement the Low-Level Tasks to have the authentication route insert a new row into the saigo_users table once a user is created. The table uses an auto-increment primary key (id) and stores the user's email.

## High-Level Objective
- After a user signs in successfully via the new Saigo authentication callback route, use the Supabase JS API to insert a row into the saigo_users table with the user's email.

## Mid-Level Objectives
- Modify the new authentication callback route (app/api/aith/saigo-callback/route.ts) so that after exchanging the code for a session, the authenticated user's email is retrieved.
- Use the Supabase server client to insert a new row into the saigo_users table with the email. (The id column is auto-increment so it does not require manual insertion.)
- Handle any potential errors gracefully (e.g. log them without aborting the redirection flow).

## Implementation Notes
- Continue using the Supabase server client imported from "@/libs/supabase/server".
- After the line where the session is established (via supabase.auth.exchangeCodeForSession(code)), retrieve the authenticated user's email. This can be done by accessing the session object or by calling supabase.auth.getUser if necessary.
- Use the Supabase insertion method (e.g., supabase.from("saigo_users").insert([{ email: userEmail }])) to add the new row.
- Do not modify the redirect behavior; the insertion is a side-effect to be performed before the redirection.
- Ensure that the insertion runs only when a valid email is obtained. It is acceptable for this insertion to fail without blocking the callback redirection; log any errors for later investigation.
- Follow existing coding standards and error handling practices in the project.

## Context

### Beginning context
- Currently, app/api/aith/saigo-callback/route.ts exchanges an authorization code for a session and then redirects the user. There is no side-effect to record additional data in the database.

### Ending context  
- After a successful session exchange in app/api/aith/saigo-callback/route.ts, the code will also use the Supabase client to insert a new row into the saigo_users table with the authenticated user's email. This will record the user's existence in a dedicated Saigo table.

## Low-Level Tasks
> Ordered from start to finish

1. Retrieve the Authenticated User's Email  
```aider
What prompt would you run to complete this task?
What file do you want to CREATE or UPDATE? -> app/api/aith/saigo-callback/route.ts
What function do you want to CREATE or UPDATE? -> After the call to supabase.auth.exchangeCodeForSession(code)
What are details you want to add to drive the code changes? -> Retrieve the authenticated user's email from the returned session object or by calling supabase.auth.getUser().
```

2. Insert the User's Email into the saigo_users Table  
```aider
What prompt would you run to complete this task?
What file do you want to CREATE or UPDATE? -> app/api/aith/saigo-callback/route.ts
What function do you want to CREATE or UPDATE? -> Within the same scope after the user email is available
What are details you want to add to drive the code changes? -> Use supabase.from("saigo_users").insert([{ email: userEmail }]) to add the row. Ensure that this insertion uses the same Supabase instance and respects error handling protocols.
```

3. Log Errors and Continue Redirection  
```aider
What prompt would you run to complete this task?
What file do you want to CREATE or UPDATE? -> app/api/aith/saigo-callback/route.ts
What function do you want to CREATE or UPDATE? -> Surround the insertion code with a try/catch block
What are details you want to add to drive the code changes? -> If the insertion fails, log the error to the console (or an error logging service) but do not prevent the normal redirection flow.
```
