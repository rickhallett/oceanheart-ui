# HDI Feature Integration Notes

This document provides information about how the HDI (Human Digital Interface) feature was integrated with the rest of the application, and what to check after removing it.

## Integration Points

The HDI feature was integrated with the main application at the following points:

1. **Navigation**: The Header component previously included a link to the HDI section
2. **Routing**: The main app router configuration included routes for HDI pages
3. **Static Assets**: Some assets in the public directory were used by HDI components
4. **Dependencies**: Python and SQLite dependencies were required for HDI functionality

## Verification Steps

After archiving the HDI feature, perform the following verification steps:

### 1. Verify Application Builds

```bash
bun build
```

The application should build without errors related to missing HDI components.

### 2. Check for Navigation References

1. Verify that the Header component no longer contains links to HDI
2. Check the Footer component for any remaining HDI links
3. Look for any "explore" or feature sections that might link to HDI

### 3. Test Core Application Functionality

1. Test the main navigation flow through the application
2. Verify that the landing page loads correctly
3. Check that user authentication still works
4. Confirm that all core pages (about, privacy, terms) load properly

### 4. Check for Console Errors

1. Open the application in a browser
2. Open the browser's developer console
3. Navigate through the application's pages
4. Verify that no console errors appear related to missing HDI components or routes

### 5. Verify API Functionality

1. Test all active API endpoints
2. Verify that API routes that might have referenced HDI endpoints are still functioning

## Dependencies That Can Be Removed

After confirming the application works correctly without HDI, consider removing these dependencies:

1. Python-related dependencies used only by HDI
2. SQLite libraries or bindings
3. Any specific packages imported only by HDI components

## Notes on Audio Content

The HDI feature included an AudioPlayer component that referenced specific audio files in the public directory. These files should be archived along with the HDI code if they aren't used elsewhere in the application.

## External Documentation References

If there are any external documentation pages or links referring to the HDI feature, they should be updated to indicate the feature has been archived.

## Restoration Instructions

If the HDI feature needs to be restored in the future:

1. Move the code from `/archived/hdi/` back to its original locations
2. Re-add navigation links in the Header component
3. Install any required dependencies 
4. Update the router configuration
5. Verify Python and SQLite are properly set up for the database functionality
